harry potter and the halfblood prince

chapter one the other minister

it was nearing midnight and the prime minister was sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind he was waiting for a call from the president of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else the more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him the more clearly the prime minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents this particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week as though anyone needed reminding but also to explain why each and every one of them was the governments fault 
the prime ministers pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations for they were neither fair nor true how on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing it was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges the bridge was fewer than ten years old and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below and how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and wellpublicized murders or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the west country that had caused so much damage to both people and property and was it his fault that one of his junior ministers herbert chorley had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family
a grim mood has gripped the country the opponent had concluded barely concealing his own broad grin
and unfortunately this was perfectly true the prime minister felt it himself people really did seem more miserable than usual even the weather was dismal all this chilly mist in the middle of july it wasnt right it wasnt normal
he turned over the second page of the memo saw how much longer it went on and gave it up as a bad job stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully it was a handsome room with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows firmly closed against the unseasonable chill with a slight shiver the prime minister got up and moved over to the window looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass it was then as he stood with his back to the room that he heard a soft cough behind him
he froze nose to nose with his own scaredlooking reflection in the dark glass he knew that cough he had heard it before he turned very slowly to face the empty room 
hello he said trying to sound braver than he felt
for a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him however a voice responded at once a crisp decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement it was coming  as the prime minister had known at the first cough  from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room
to the prime minister of muggles urgent we meet kindly respond immediately sincerely fudge
the man in the painting looked inquiringly at the prime minister
er said the prime minister listen its not a very good time for me im waiting for a telephone call you see from the president of
that can be rearranged said the portrait at once the prime ministers heart sank he had been afraid of that
but i really was rather hoping to speak
we shall arrange for the president to forget to call he will telephone tomorrow night instead said the little man kindly respond immediately to mr fudge

i oh  very well said the prime minister weakly yes ill see fudge
he hurried back to his desk straightening his tie as he went he had barely resumed his seat and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece he watched trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm as a portly man appeared within the flames spinning as fast as a top seconds later he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pinstriped cloak a limegreen bowler hat in his hand
ah prime minister said cornelius fudge striding forward with his hand outstretched good to see you again
the prime minister could not honestly return this compliment so said nothing at all he was not remotely pleased to see fudge whose occasional appearances apart from being downright alarming in themselves generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news furthermore fudge was looking distinctly careworn he was thinner balder and grayer and his face had a crumpled look the prime minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before and it never boded well
how can i help you he said shaking fudges hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk
difficult to know where to begin muttered fudge pulling up the chair sitting down and placing his green bowler upon his knees what a week what a week
had a bad one too have you asked the prime minister stiffly hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from fudge
yes of course said fudge rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the prime minister ive been having the same week you have prime minister the brockdale bridge the bones and vance murders not to mention the ruckus in the west country
youeryouri mean to say some of your people werewere involved in thosethose things were they
fudge fixed the prime minister with a rather stern look of course they were he said surely youve realized whats going on
i hesitated the prime minister
it was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike fudges visits so much he was after all the prime minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy but of course it had been like this from his very first meeting with fudge on his very first evening as prime minister he remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day
he had been standing alone in this very office savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming when he had heard a cough behind him just like tonight and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him announcing that the minister of magic was about to arrive and introduce himself
naturally he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad he had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him though this had been nothing to how he felt when a selfproclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand he had remained speechless throughout fudges kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the ministry of magic took responsibility for the whole wizarding community and prevented the nonmagical population from getting wind of them it was said fudge a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control the prime minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point fudge had then patted the shoulder of the slilldumbstruck prime minister in a fatherly sort of way
not to worry he had said its oddson youll never see me again ill only bother you if theres something really serious going on our end something thats likely to affect the mugglesthe nonmagical population i should say otherwise its live and let live and i must say youre taking it a lot better than your predecessor he tried to throw me out the window thought i was a hoax planned by the opposition
at this the prime minister had found his voice at last youreyoure not a hoax then
it had been his last desperate hope
no said fudge gently no im afraid im not look
and he had turned the prime ministers teacup into a gerbil
but said the prime minister breathlessly watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech but whywhy has nobody told me
the minister of magic only reveals himor herself to the muggle prime minister of the day said fudge poking his wand back inside his jacket we find it the best way to maintain secrecy
but then bleated the prime minister why hasnt a former prime minister warned me
at this fudge had actually laughed
my dear prime minister are you ever going to tell anybody
still chortling fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace stepped into the emerald flames and vanished with a whooshing sound the prime minister had stood there quite motionless and realized that he would never as long as he lived dare mention this encounter to a living soul for who in the wide world would believe him
the shock had taken a little while to wear off for a time he had tried to convince himself that fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign in a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced fudges arrival to the prime ministers dismay however the portrait had proved impossible to remove when several carpenters a builder or two an art historian and the chancellor of the exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall the prime minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning or else scratching his nose even once or twice simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddybrown canvas behind however he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened
then three years ago on a night very like tonight the prime minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of fudge who had burst out of the fireplace sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic before the prime minister could ask why he was dripping all over the axminster fudge had started ranting about a prison the prime minister had never heard of a man named serious black something that sounded like hogwarts and a boy called harry potter none of which made the remotest sense to the prime minister
ive just come from azkaban fudge had panted tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket middle of the north sea you know nasty flight the dementors are in uproarhe shudderedtheyve never had a breakout before anyway i had to come to you prime minister blacks a known muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin youknowwho but of course you dont even know who youknowwho is he had gazed hopelessly at the prime minister for a moment then said well sit down sit down id better fill you in have a whiskey
the prime minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office let alone offered his own whiskey but he sat nevertheless fudge pulled out his wand conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air pushed one of them into the prime ministers hand and drew up a chair
fudge had talked for more than an hour at one point he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment which he had thrust into the prime ministers whiskeyfree hand when at last fudge had stood up to leave the prime minister had stood up too
so you think that he had squinted down at the name in his left hand lord vol
hewhomustnotbenamed snarled fudge
im sorry you think that hewhomustnotbenamed is still alive then
well dumbledore says he is said fudge as he had fastened his pinstriped cloak under his chin but weve never found him if you ask me hes not dangerous unless hes got support so its black we ought to be worrying about youll put out that warning then excellent well i hope we dont see each other again prime minister good night
but they had seen each other again less than a year later a harassedlooking fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the prime minister that there had been a spot of bother at the kwidditch or that was what it had sounded like world cup and that several muggles had been involved but that the prime minister was not to worry the fact that youknowwhos mark had been seen again meant nothing fudge was sure it was an isolated incident and the muggle liaison office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke
oh and i almost forgot fudge had added were importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the triwizard tournament quite routine but the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures tells me that its down in the rule book that we have to notify you if were bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country
iwhatdragons spluttered the prime minister
yes three said fudge and a sphinx well good day to you
the prime minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it but no less than two years later fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from azkaban
a mass breakout repeated the prime minister hoarsely
no need to worry no need to worry shouted fudge already with one foot in the flames well have them rounded up in no timejust thought you ought to know
and before the prime minister could shout now wait just one moment fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks
whatever the press and the opposition might say the prime minister was not a foolish man it had not escaped his notice that despite fudges assurances at their first meeting they were now seeing rather a lot of each other nor that fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit little though he liked to think about the minister of magic or as he always called fudge in his head the other minister the prime minister could not help but fear that the next time fudge appeared it would be with graver news still the site therefore of fudge stepping out of the fire once more looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the prime minister did not know exactly why he was there was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week
how should i know whats going on in theerwizarding community snapped the prime minister now i have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without
we have the same concerns fudge interrupted the brockdale bridge didnt wear out that wasnt really a hurricane those murders were not the work of muggles and herbert chorleys family would be safer without him we are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to st mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries the move should be effected tonight
what do you im afraid i  what blustered the prime minister
fudge took a great deep breath and said prime minister i am very sorry to have to tell you that hes back hewhomustnotbenamed is back
back when you say back hes alive i mean
the prime minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously when fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier
yes alive said fudge that isi dont knowis a man alive if he cant be killed i dont really understand it and dumbledore wont explain properlybut anyway hes certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing so i suppose for the purposes of our discussion yes hes alive
the prime minister did not know what to say to this but a persistent habit of wishing to appear wellinformed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations
is serious black witherhewhomustnotbenamed
black black said fudge distractedly turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers sirius black you mean merlins beard no blacks dead turns out we wereermistaken about black he was innocent after all and he wasnt in league with hewhomustnotbenamed either i mean he added defensively spinning the bowler hat still faster all the evidence pointedwe had more than fifty eyewitnessesbut anyway as i say hes dead murdered as a matter of fact on ministry of magic premises theres going to be an inquiry actually
to his great surprise the prime minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for fudge at this point it was however eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge not yet anyway
while the prime minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk fudge continued but blacks bytheby now the point is were at war prime minister and steps must be taken
at war repeated the prime minister nervously surely thats a little bit of an overstatement
hewhomustnotbenamed has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of azkaban in january said fudge speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a limegreen blur since they have moved into the open they have been wreaking havoc the brockdale bridgehe did it prime minister he threatened a mass muggle killing unless i stood aside for him and
good grief so its your fault those people were killed and im having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and i dont know what else said the prime minister furiously
my fault said fudge coloring up are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that
maybe not said the prime minister standing up and striding about the room but i would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity
do you really think i wasnt already making every effort demanded fudge heatedly every auror in the ministry wasand istrying to find him and round up his followers but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades
so i suppose youre going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the west country too said the prime minister his temper rising with every pace he took it was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public almost worse than it being the governments fault after all
that was no hurricane said fudge miserably
excuse me barked the prime minister now positively stamping up and down trees uprooted roofs ripped off lampposts bent horrible injuries
it was the death eaters said fudge hewhomustnotbenameds followers and and we suspect giant involvement
the prime minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall what involvement
fudge grimaced he used giants last time when he wanted to go for the grand effect he said the office of misinformation has been working around the clock weve had teams of obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the muggles who saw what really happened weve got most of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures running around somerset but we cant find the giantits been a disaster
you dont say said the prime minister furiously
i wont deny that morale is pretty low at the ministry said fudge what with all that and then losing amelia bones
losing who
amelia bones head of the department of magical law enforcement we think hewhomustnotbenamed may have murdered her in person because she was a very gifted witch andand all the evidence was that she put up a real fight
fudge cleared his throat and with an effort it seemed stopped spinning his bowler hat
but that murder was in the newspapers said the prime minister momentarily diverted from his anger our newspapers amelia bones it just said she was a middleaged woman who lived alone it was aa nasty killing wasnt it its had rather a lot of publicity the police are baffled you see
fudge sighed well of course they are he said killed in a room that was locked from the inside wasnt she we on the other hand know exactly who did it not that that gets us any further toward catching him and then there was emmeline vance maybe you didnt hear about that one
oh yes i did said the prime minister it happened just around the corner from here as a matter of fact the papers had a field day with it breakdown of law and order in the prime ministers backyard
and as if all that wasnt enough said fudge barely listening to the prime minister weve got dementors swarming all over the place attacking people left right and center
once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the prime minister but he was wiser now
i thought dementors guard the prisoners in azkaban he said cautiously
they did said fudge wearily but not anymore theyve deserted the prison and joined hewhomustnotbenamed i wont pretend that wasnt a blow
but said the prime minister with a sense of dawning horror didnt you tell me theyre the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people
thats right and theyre breeding thats whats causing all this mist
the prime minister sank weakkneed into the nearest chair the idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters made him feel quite faint
now see here fudgeyouve got to do something its your responsibility as minister of magic
my dear prime minister you cant honestly think im still minister of magic after all this i was sacked three days ago the whole wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight ive never known them so united in my whole term of office said fudge with a brave attempt at a smile
the prime minister was momentarily lost for words despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed he still rather felt for the shrunkenlooking man sitting opposite him
im very sorry he said finally if theres anything i can do
its very kind of you prime minister but there is nothing i was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor i rather thought hed be here by now but of course hes very busy at the moment with so much going on
fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill catching fudges eye the portrait said hell be here in a moment hes just finishing a letter to dumbledore
i wish him luck said fudge sounding bitter for the first time ive been writing to dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight but he wont budge if hed just been prepared to persuade the boy i might still be well maybe scrimgeour will have more success
fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait which suddenly spoke in its crisp official voice
to the prime minister of muggles requesting a meeting urgent kindly respond immediately rufus scrimgeour minister of magic
yes yes fine said the prime minister distractedly and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again rose up and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug
fudge got to his feet and after a moments hesitation the prime minister did the same watching the new arrival straighten up dust down his long black robes and look around
the prime ministers first foolish thought was that rufus scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion there were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wirerimmed spectacles and a certain rangy loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp there was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness the prime minister thought he understood why the wizarding community preferred scrimgeour to fudge as a leader in these dangerous times
how do you do said the prime minister politely holding out his hand
scrimgeour grasped it briefly his eyes scanning the room then pulled out a wand from under his robes
fudge told you everything he asked striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand the prime minister heard the lock click
eryes said the prime minister and if you dont mind id rather that door remained unlocked
id rather not be interrupted said scrimgeour shortly or watched he added pointing his wand at the windows so that the curtains swept across them right well im a busy man so lets get down lo business first of all we need to discuss your security
the prime minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied i am perfectly happy with the security ive already got thank you very
well were not scrimgeour cut in itll be a poor lookout for the muggles if their prime minister gets put under the imperius curse the new secretary in your outer office
im not getting rid of kingsley shacklebolt if thats what youre suggesting said the prime minister hotly hes highly efficient gets through twice the work the rest of them
thats because hes a wizard said scrimgeour without a flicker of a smile a highly trained auror who has been assigned to you for your protection
now wait a moment declared the prime minister you cant just put your people into my office i decide who works for me
i thought you were happy with shacklebolt said scrimgeour coldly
i amthats to say i was
then theres no problem is there said scrimgeour
i well as long as shacklebolts work continues to be er excellent said the prime minister lamely but scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him
now about herbert chorley your junior minister he continued the one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck
what about him asked the prime minister
he has clearly reacted to a poorly performed imperius curse said scrimgeour its addled his brains but he could still be dangerous
hes only quacking said the prime minister weakly surely a bit of a rest maybe go easy on the drink
a team of healers from st mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries are examining him as we speak so far he has attempted to strangle three of them said scrimgeour i think it best that we remove him from muggle society for a while
i well hell be all right wont he said the prime minister anxiously
scrimgeour merely shrugged already moving back toward the fireplace
well thats really all i had to say i will keep you posted of developments prime ministeror at least i shall probably be too busy to come personally in which case i shall send fudge here he has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity
fudge attempted to smile but was unsuccessful he merely looked as though he had a toothache scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green the prime minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last
but for heavens sakeyoure wizards you can do magic surely you can sort outwellanything
scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with fudge who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly the trouble is the other side can do magic too prime minister
and with that the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished

chapter two spinners end


many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime ministers windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown rubbishstrewn banks an immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous there was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fishandchip wrappings in the tall grass
but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river the fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon the figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak rustling over the grass
with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized
wait
the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth it leapt from its hiding place and up the bank there was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead
the second figure turned over the animal with its toe
just a fox said a womans voice dismissively from under the hood i thought perhaps an aurorcissy wait
but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down
cissynarcissalisten to me
the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away
go back bella
you must listen to me
ive listened already ive made my decision leave me alone
the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street the other woman bella followed at once side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness
he lives here asked bella in a voice of contempt here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot
but narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road
cissy wait
bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness the pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other
cissy you must not do this you cant trust him
the dark lord trusts him doesnt he
the dark lord is i believe mistaken bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone this is a betrayal of the dark lords
let go bella snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the others face bella merely laughed
cissy your own sister you wouldnt
there is nothing i wouldnt do anymore narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light bella let go of her sisters arm as though burned
narcissa
but narcissa had rushed ahead rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses at last narcissa hurried up a street named spinners end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room
she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze after a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes
narcissa threw back her hood she was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person
narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too what a pleasant surprise
severus she said in a strained whisper may i speak to you its urgent
but of course
he stood back to allow her to pass him into the house her stillhooded sister followed without invitation
snape she said curtly as she passed him
bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them
they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell the walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candlefilled lamp hung from the ceiling the place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited
snape gestured narcissa to the sofa she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape as she moved to stand behind narcissa
so what can i do for you snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters
we we are alone arent we narcissa asked quietly
yes of course well wormtails here but were not counting vermin are we
he pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen
as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests said snape lazily
the man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room he had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper his left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove
narcissa he said in a squeaky voice and bellatrix how charming
wormtail will get us drinks if youd like them said snape and then he will return to his bedroom
wormtail winced as though snape had thrown something at him
i am not your servant he squeaked avoiding snapes eye
really i was under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me
to assist yesbut not to make you drinks andand clean your house
i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said snape silkily this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord
i can speak to him myself if i want to
of course you can said snape sneering but in the meantime bring us drinks some of the elfmade wine will do
wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door they heard banging and a clinking of glasses within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the bookcovered door behind him
snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused
the dark lord he said raising his glass and draining it
the sisters copied him snape refilled their glasses as narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush severus im sorry to come here like this but i had to see you i think you are the only one who can help me
snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs
my apologies said snape he has lately taken to listening at doors i dont know what he means by it you were saying narcissa
she took a great shuddering breath and started again
severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but
then you ought to hold your tongue snarled bellatrix particularly in present company
present company repeated snape sardonically and what urn i to understand by that bellatrix
that i dont trust you snape as you very well know
narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into bellatrixs glowering face
narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions well continue bellatrix said snape why is it that you do not trust me
a hundred reasons she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table where to start where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these years that youve lived in dumbledores pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the sorcerers stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord was reborn where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years
she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands
snape smiled
before i answer you — oh yes bellatrix i am going to answer you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark lord before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn do you really think that the dark lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answers i would be sitting here talking to you
she hesitated
i know he believes you but  
you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever seen
bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited snape did not press the point he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued you ask where i was when the dark lord fell i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore you know i presume that it was on the dark lords orders that i took up the post
she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her
you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius — he inclined his head slightly to narcissa — and many others did not attempt to find him i believed him finished i am not proud of it i was wrong but there it is  if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left
hed have me said bellatrix passionately i who spent many years in azkaban for him
yes indeed most admirable said snape in a bored voice of i nurse you werent a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine —
gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing dumbledores pet
not quite said snape calmly he wouldnt give me the defense against the dark arts job you know seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse    tempt me into my old ways
this was your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead
hardly said snape although the dark lord is pleased that i never deserted my post i had sixteen years of information on dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful welcomeback present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant azkaban is   
but you stayed —
yes bellatrix i stayed said snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban they were rounding up the death eaters you know dumbledores protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and i used it i repeat the dark lord does not complain that i stayed so i do not see why you do
i think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting why i stood between the dark lord and the sorcerers stone that is easily answered he did not know whether he could trust me he thought like you that i had turned from faithful death eater to dumbledores stooge he was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard he did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to dumbledore or the ministry i deeply regret that he did not trust me he would have returned to power three years sooner as it was i saw only greedy and unworthy quirrell attempting to steal the stone and i admit i did all i could to thwart him
bellatrixs mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine
but you didnt return when he came back you didnt fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn —
correct i returned two hours later i returned on dumbledores orders
on dumbledores —  she began in tones of outrage
think said snape impatient again think by waiting two hours just two hours i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts as a spy by allowing dumbledore to think that i was only returning to the dark lords side because i was ordered to i have been able to pass information on dumbledore and the order of the phoenix ever since consider bellatrix the dark mark had been growing stronger for months i knew he must be about to return all the death eaters knew i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like karkaroff didnt i
the dark lords initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely one assure you when i explained that one remained faithful although dumbledore thought i was his man yes the dark lord thought that i had left him forever but he was wrong
but what use have you been sneered bellatrix what useful information have we had from you
my information has been conveyed directly to the dark lord said snape if he chooses not to share it with you —
he shares everything with me said bellatrix firing up at once he calls me his most loyal his most faithful —
does he said snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief does he still after the fiasco at the ministry
that was not my fault said bellatrix flushing the dark lord has in the past entrusted me with his most precious — if lucius hadnt —
dont you dare — dont you dare blame my husband said narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister
there is no point apportioning blame said snape smoothly what is done is done
but not by you said bellatrix furiously no you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not snape
my orders were to remain behind said snape perhaps you disagree with the dark lord perhaps you think that dumbledore would not have noticed if i had joined forces with the death eaters to fight the order of the phoenix and — forgive me — you speak of dangers    you were facing six teenagers were you not
they were joined as you very well know by half of the order before long snarled bellatrix and while we are on the subject of the order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters dont you
i am not the secretkeeper i cannot speak the name of the place you understand how the enchantment works i think the dark lord is satisfied with the information i have passed him on the order it led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of sirius black though i give you full credit for finishing him off
he inclined his head and toasted her her expression did nor soften
you are avoiding my last question snape harry potter you could have killed him at any point in the past five years you have not done it why
have you discussed this matter with the dark lord asked snape
he    lately we  i am asking you snape
if i had murdered harry potter the dark lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible —
you claim you foresaw his use of the boy she jeered
i do not claim it i had no idea of his plans i have already confessed that i thought the dark lord dead i am merely trying to explain why the dark lord is not sorry that potter survived at least until a year ago   
but why did you keep him alive
have you not understood me it was only dumbledores protection that was keeping me out of azkaban do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me but there was more to it than that i should remind you that when potter first arrived at hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great dark wizard which was how he had survived the dark lords attack indeed many of the dark lords old followers thought potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more i was curious one admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle
of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all he has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends he is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and selfsatisfied as was his father before him i have done my utmost to have him thrown out of hogwarts where i believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me i would have been a fool to risk it with dumbledore close at hand
and through all this we are supposed to believe dumbledore has never suspected you asked bellatrix he has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still
i have played my part well said snape and you overlook dumbledores greatest weakness he has to believe the best of people i spun him a tale of deepest remorse when i joined his staff fresh from my death eater days and he embraced me with open arms — though as i say never allowing me nearer the dark arts than he could help dumbledore has been a great wizard — oh yes he has for bellatrix had made a scathing noise the dark lord acknowledges it i am pleased to say however that dumbledore is growing old the duel with the dark lord last month shook him he has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were but through all these years he has never stopped trusting severus snape and therein lies my great value to the dark lord
bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack snape next taking advantage of her silence snape turned to her sister
now    you came to ask me for help narcissa
narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair
yes severus i — i think you are the only one who can help me i have nowhere else to turn lucius is in jail and   
she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids
the dark lord has forbidden me to speak of it narcissa continued her eyes still closed he wishes none to know of the plan it is  very secret but —
if he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said snape at once the dark lords word is law
narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house
there she said triumphantly to her sister even snape says so you were told not to talk so hold your silence
but snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk he turned around to face narcissa frowning
it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice i am one of the few the dark lord has told nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord
i thought you must know about it said narcissa breathing more freely he trusts you so severus 
you know about the plan said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage you know
certainly said snape but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all
severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks my son    my only son   
draco should be proud said bellatrix indifferently the dark lord is granting him a great honor and i will say this for draco he isnt shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect —
narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape
thats because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store why severus why my son it is too dangerous this is vengeance lor luciuss mistake i know it
snape said nothing he looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her
thats why hes chosen draco isnt it she persisted to punish lucius
if draco succeeds said snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others
but he wont succeed sobbed narcissa how can he when the dark lord himself— 
bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve
i only meant   that nobody has yet succeeded    severus    please    you are you have always been dracos favorite teacher    you are luciuss old friend  i beg you   you are the dark lords favorite his most trusted advisor    will you speak to him persuade him — 
the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it said snape flatly i cannot pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius lucius was supposed to be in charge he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed
then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge choked narcissa he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying
when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little selfrestraint she still possessed standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robes her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped you could do it you could do it instead of draco severus you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us —
snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands looking down into her tearstained face he said slowly he intends me to do it in the end i think but he is determined that draco should try first you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy
in other words it doesnt matter to him if draco is killed
the dark lord is very angry repeated snape quietly he failed to hear the prophecy you know as well as i do narcissa that he does not forgive easily
she crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor
my only son    my only son   
you should be proud said bellatrix ruthlessly if i had sons i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord
narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa he then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand
narcissa thats enough drink this listen to me
she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip
it might be possible  for me to help draco
she sat up her face paperwhite her eyes huge
severus — oh severus — you would help him would you look after him see he comes to no harm
i can try
she flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at snapes feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it
if you are there to protect him    severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow
the unbreakable vow
snapes expression was blank unreadable bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter
arent you listening narcissa oh hell try im sure    the usual empty words the usual slithering out of action    oh on the dark lords orders of course
snape did not look at bellatrix his black eyes were fixed upon narcissas tearfilled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand
certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow he said quietly perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder
bellatrixs mouth fell open snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite narcissa beneath bellatrixs astonished gaze they grasped right hands
you will need your wand bellatrix said snape coldly
she drew it still looking astonished
and you will need to move a little closer he said
she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands
narcissa spoke
will you severus watch over my son draco as he attempts to fulfill the dark lords wishes
i will said snape
a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a redhot wire
and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm
i will said snape
a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain
and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail   whispered narcissa snapes hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform
there was a moments silence bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide
i will said snape
bellatrixs astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique of flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a rope like a fiery snake

chapter three will and wont


harry potter was snoring loudly he had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours staring out at the darkening street and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane his glasses askew and his mouth wide open the misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside and the artificial light drained his face of all color so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair
the room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish owl feathers apple cores and sweet wrappers littered the floor a number of spellbooks lay higgledypiggledy among the tangled robes on his bed and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk the headline of one blared
harry potter the chosen one
rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the ministry of magic during which hewhomustnotbenamed was sighted once more
were not allowed to talk about it dont ask me anything said one agitated obliviator who refused to give his name as he left the ministry last night
nevertheless highly placed sources within the ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled hall of prophecy
though ministry spokes wizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place a growing number of the wizarding community believe that the death eaters now serving sentences in azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy the nature of that prophecy is unknown although speculation is rife that it concerns harry potter the only person ever known to have survived the killing curse and who is also known to have been at the ministry on the night in question some are going so far as to call potter the chosen one believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of hewhomustno tbenamed
the current whereabouts of the prophecy if it exists are unknown although ctd pagetwo column five
a second newspaper lay beside die first this one bore die headline
scrimgeour succeeds fudge
most of this front page was taken up with a large blackandwhite picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face the picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling
rufus scrimgeour previously head of the auror office in the department of magical law enforcement has succeeded cornelius fudge as minister of magic the appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the wizarding community though rumors of a rift between the new minister and albus dumbledore newly reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot surfaced within hours of scrimgeour taking office
scrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he had met with dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job but refused to comment on the topics under discussion albus dumbledore is known to ctd page three column two
to the left of this paper sat another which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students sapety was visible
newly appointed minister of magic rufus scrimgeour spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this autumn
for obvious reasons the ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans said the minister although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms a complex array of countercurses and a small task force of aurors dedicated solely to the protection of hogwarts school
most seem reassured by the new ministers tough stand on student safety said mrs augusta longbottom my grandson neville — a good friend of harry potters incidentally who fought the death eaters alongside him at the ministry in june and —
but the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it inside it was a magnificent snowy owl her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but harry was too deeply asleep to hear her
a large trunk stood in the very middle of the room its lid was open it looked expectant yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear sweets empty ink bottles and broken quills that coated the very bottom nearby on the floor lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words
issued on behalf of
the ministry of magic
protecting your home and family against dark forces
the wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the death eaters observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you your family and your home from attack
one you are advised not to leave the house alone
two particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness wherever possible arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen
three review the security arrangements around your house making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as shield and disillusionment charms and in the case of underage family members sidealongapparition
four agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect death eaters masquerading as others by use of the polyjuice potion see page two
five should you feel that a family member colleague friend or neighbor is acting in a strange manner contact the magical law enforcement squad at once they may have been put under the imperius curse see page four
six should the dark mark appear over any dwelling place or other building do not enter but contact the auror office immediately
seven unconfirmed sightings suggest that the death eaters may now be using inferi see page onezero any sighting of an inferius or encounter with same should be reported to the ministry immediately
harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so making his glasses still more lopsided but he did not wake up an alarm clock repaired by harry several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven beside it held in place by harrys relaxed hand was a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat
dear harry
if it is convenient to you i shall call at number four privet drive this coming friday at eleven pm to escort you to the burrow where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays
if you are agreeable i should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which i hope to attend on the way to the  burrow i shall explain this more fully when i see you
kindly send your answer by return of this owl hoping to see you this friday
i am yours most sincerely
albus dumbledore
though he already knew it by heart harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven oclock that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of privet drive he knew it was pointless to keep rereading dumbledores words harry had sent back his yes with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait either dumbledore was going to come or he was not
but harry had not packed it just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company he could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong — his reply to dumbledores letter might have gone astray dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again the only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl hedwig safely in her cage
the minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment the streetlamp outside the window went out
harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement a tall figure in a long billowing cloak was walking up the garden path
harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk even as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of crisps across the room the doorbell rang downstairs in the living room his uncle vernon shouted who the blazes is calling at this lime of night
harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other he had completely forgotten to warn the dursleys that dumbledore might be coming feeling both panicky mid close to laughter he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say good evening you must be mr dursley i daresay harry has told you i would be coming for him
harry ran down the stairs two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom as long experience had taught him to remain out of arms reach of his uncle whenever possible there in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waistlength silver hair and beard halfmoon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and one pointed hat vernon dursley whose mustache was quite as bushy as dumbledores though black and who was wearing a puce dressing gown was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes
judging by your look of stunned disbelief harry did not warn you that i was coming said dumbledore pleasantly however let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house it is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times
he stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him
it is a long time since my last visit said dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at uncle vernon i must say your agapanthus are flourishing
vernon dursley said nothing at all harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soon — the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point — but something about dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath it might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even uncle vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully
ah good evening harry said dumbledore looking up at him through his halfmoon glasses with a most satisfied expression excellent excellent
these words seemed to rouse uncle vernon it was clear that as far as he was concerned any man who could look at harry and say excellent was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye
i dont mean to be rude — he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable
yet sadly accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often dumbledore finished the sentence gravely best to say nothing at all my dear man ah and this must be petunia
the kitchen door had opened and there stood harrys aunt wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual prebedtime wipedown of all the kitchen surfaces her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock
albus dumbledore said dumbledore when uncle vernon failed to effect an introduction we have corresponded of course harry thought this an odd way of reminding aunt petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter but aunt petunia did not challenge the term and this must be your son dudley
dudley had that moment peered round the living room door his large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied his mouth gaping in astonishment and i car dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the dursleys were going to say anything but as the ilcncc stretched on he smiled
shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room
dudley scrambled out of the way as dumbledore passed him harry still clutching the telescope and trainers jumped the last few stairs and followed dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest he looked quite extraordinarily out of place
arent — arent we leaving sir harry asked anxiously
yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said dumbledore and i would prefer not to do so in the open we shall trespass upon your aunt and uncles hospitality only a little longer
you will will you
vernon dursley had entered the room petunia at his shoulder and dudley skulking behind them both
yes said dumbledore simply i shall
he drew his wand so rapidly that harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position
we may as well be comfortable said dumbledore pleasantly
as he replaced his wand in his pocket harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it looked as though his flesh had been burned away 
sir — what happened to your — 
later harry said dumbledore please sit down
harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the dursleys who seemed stunned into silence
i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment dumbledore said to uncle vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness
a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair the bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honeycolored liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room
madam rosmerta’s finest oakmatured mead said dumbledore raising his glass to harry who caught hold of his own and sipped he had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely the dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads harry could not suppress a suspicion that dumbledore was rather enjoying himself
well harry said dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty has arisen which i hope you will be able to solve for us by us i mean the order of the phoenix but first of all i must tell you that siriuss will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned
over on the sofa uncle vernon’s head turned but harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except oh right
this is in the main fairly straightforward dumbledore went on you add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of siriuss personal possessions the slightly problematic part of the legacy —
his godfathers dead said uncle vernon loudly from the sofa dumbledore and harry both turned to look at him the glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of vernon’s head he attempted to beat it away hes dead his godfather
yes said dumbledore he did not ask harry why he had not confided in the dursleys our problem he continued to harry as if there had been no interruption is that sirius also left you number twelve grimmauld place
hes been left a house said uncle vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him
you can keep using it as headquarters said harry i dont care you can have it i dont really want it harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve grimmauld place again if he could help it he thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave
that is generous said dumbledore we have however vacated the building temporarily
why
well said dumbledore ignoring the mutterings of uncle vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of black sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother regulus predeceased him and both were childless while his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood
a vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of siriuss mother that hung in the hall of number twelve grimmauld place flashed into harrys mind i bet there has he said
quite said dumbledore and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of siriuss living relatives which would mean his cousin bellatrix lestrange
without realizing what he was doing harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor bellatrix lestrange siriuss killer inherit his house
no he said
well obviously we would prefer that she didnt get it either said dumbledore calmly the situation is fraught with complications we do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from siriuss hands it might be that bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position
but how are you going to find out if im allowed to own it
fortunately said dumbledore there is a simple test
he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle vernon shouted will you get these ruddy things off us
harry looked around all three of the dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere
oh im so sorry said dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again all three glasses vanished but it would have been better manners to drink it you know
it looked as though uncle vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with aunt petunia and dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on dumbledores wand
you see dumbledore said turning back to harry and again speaking as though uncle vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited —
he flicked his wand for a fifth time there was a loud crack and a houseelf appeared with a snout for a nose giant bats ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rags aunt petunia let out a hairraising shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and uncle vernon bellowed what the hell is that
kreacher finished dumbledore
kreacher wont kreacher wont kreacher wont croaked the houseelf quite as loudly as uncle vernon stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears k readier belongs to miss bellatrix oh yes kreacher belongs to the blacks kreacher wants his new mistress kreacher wont go to the potter brat kreacher wont wont wont —
as you can see harry said dumbledore loudly over kreachers continued croaks of wont wont wont kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership
i dont care said harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping houseelf i dont want him
wont won’t wont wont —
you would prefer him to pass into the ownership of bellatrix lestrange bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix for the past year
wont wont won’t wont —
harry stared at dumbledore he knew that kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with bellatrix lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed sirius was repugnant
give him an order said dumbledore if he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey if not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress
wont wont won’t wont
kreachers voice had risen to a scream harry could think of nothing to say except kreacher shut up
it looked for a moment as though kreacher was going to choke he grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging after a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum
well that simplifies matters said dumbledore cheerfully it seems that sirius knew what he was doing you are the rightful owner of number twelve grimmauld place and of kreacher
do i — do i have to keep him with me harry asked aghast us kreacher thrashed around at his feet
not if you dont want to said dumbledore if i might make ii suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there in that way the other houseelves could keep an eye on him
yeah said harry in relief yeah ill do that er — kreacher — i want you to go to hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other houseelves
kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave harry one upsidedown look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished
good said dumbledore there is also the matter of the hippogriff buckbeak hagrid has been looking after him since sirius died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements —
no said harry at once he can stay with hagrid i think buckbeak would prefer that
hagrid will be delighted said dumbledore smiling he was thrilled to see buckbeak again incidentally we have decided in the interests of buckbeaks safety to rechristen him witherwings for the time being though i doubt that the ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death now harry is your trunk packed
erm  
doubtful that i would turn up dumbledore suggested shrewdly
ill just go and — er — finish off said harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers
it took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his invisibility cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of colorchange ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding hedwigs cage in the other he made his way back downstairs
he was disappointed to discover that dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room
nobody was talking dumbledore was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and harry did not dare look at the dursleys as he said professor — im ready now
good said dumbledore just one last thing then and he turned to speak to the dursleys once more
as you will no doubt be aware harry comes of age in a years time —
no said aunt petunia speaking for the first time since dumbledores arrival
im sorry said dumbledore politely
no he doesnt hes a month younger than dudley and dudders doesnt turn eighteen until the year after next
ah said dumbledore pleasantly but in the wizarding world we come of age at seventeen
uncle vernon muttered preposterous but dumbledore ignored him
now as you already know the wizard called lord voldemort was returned to this country the wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare harry whom lord voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him is though he were your own
dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the dursleys drew very slightly closer together
you did not do as i asked you have never treated harry as a son he has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands the best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you
both aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than dudley squeezed between them
us — mistreat dudders what dyou —  began uncle vernon furiously but dumbledore raised his ringer for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck uncle vernon dumb
the magic i evoked fifteen years ago means that harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house home however miserable he has been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom this magic will cease to operate the moment that harry turns seventeen in other words at the moment he becomes a man i ask only this that you allow harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ensure that the protection continues until that time
none of the dursleys said anything dudley was frowning slightly as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated uncle vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat aunt petunia however was oddly flushed
well harry    time for us to be off said dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his long black cloak until we meet again he said to the dursleys who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room
bye said harry hastily to the dursleys and followed dumbledore who paused beside harrys trunk upon which hedwigs cage was perched
we do not want to be encumbered by these just now he said pulling out his wand again i shall send them to the burrow to await us there however i would like you to bring your invisibility cloak    just in case
harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show dumbledore the mess within when he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk cage and hedwig vanished dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness
and now harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure

chapter four horace slughorn


despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him harry felt distinctly awkward as oneone uy set off down privet drive together he had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of hogwarts before there was usually a desk between them the memory of their last facetoface encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened harrys sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of dumbledores most prized possessions 
dumbledore however seemed completely relaxed
keep your wand at the ready harry he said brightly
but i thought im not allowed to use magic outside school sir
if there is an attack said dumbledore i give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you however i do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight
why not sir
you are with me said dumbledore simply this will do harry
he came to an abrupt halt at the end of privet drive
you have not of course passed your apparition test he said
no said harry i thought you had to be seventeen
you do said dumbledore so you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly my left if you dont mind — as you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment
harry gripped dumbledore’s proffered forearm
very good said dumbledore well here we go
harry felt dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he was being pressed very hard from all directions he could not breathe there were iron bands tightening around his chest his eyeballs were being forced back into his head his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then —
he gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes he felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube it was a few seconds before he realized that privet drive had vanished he and dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches his comprehension catching up with his senses harry realized that he had just apparated for the first time in his life
are you all right asked dumbledore looking down at him solicitously the sensation does take some getting used to
im fine said harry rubbing his ears which felt as though they had left privet drive rather reluctantly but i think i might prefer brooms   
dumbledore smiled drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck and said this way
he set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few houses according to a clock on a nearby church it was almost midnight
so tell me harry said dumbledore your scar  has it been hurting at all
harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed i he lightningshaped mark
no he said and ive been wondering about that i thought it would be burning all the time now voldemorts getting so powerful again
he glanced up at dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression
i on the other hand thought otherwise said dumbledore lord voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying it appears that he is now employing occlumency against you
well im not complaining said harry who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into voldemorts mind
they turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter harry looked sideways at dumbledore again professor
harry
er — where exactly are we
this harry is the charming village of budleigh babberton
and what are we doing here
ah yes of course i havent told you said dumbledore well i have lost count of the number of times i have said this in recent years but we are once again one member of staff short we are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to hogwarts
how can i help with that sir 
oh i think well find a use for you said dumbledore vaguely left here harry
they proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with houses all the windows were dark the odd chill that had lain over privet drive for two weeks persisted here too thinking of dementors harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket
professor why couldnt we just apparate directly into your old colleagues house
because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door said dumbledore courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry in any case most wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted apparators at hogwarts for instance —
— you cant apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds said harry quickly hermione granger told me
and she is quite right we turn left again
the church clock chimed midnight behind them harry wondered why dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that conversation had been established he had more pressing questions to ask
sir i saw in the daily prophet that fudge has been sacked   
correct said dumbledore now turning up a steep side street he has been replaced as i am sure you also saw by rufus scrimgeour who used to be head of the auror office
is he  do you think hes good asked harry
an interesting question said dumbledore he is able certainly a more decisive and forceful personality than cornelius
yes but i meant —
i know what you meant rufus is a man of action and having fought dark wizards for most of his working life does not underestimate lord voldemort
harry waited but dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with scrimgeour that the daily prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject so he changed ii and  sir  i saw about madam bones
yes said dumbledore quietly a terrible loss she was a great witch just up here i think — ouch
he had pointed with his injured hand
professor what happened to your — 
i have no time to explain now said dumbledore it is a thrilling tale i wish to do it justice
he smiled at harry who understood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions
sir — i got a ministry of magic leaflet by owl about security measures we should all take against the death eaters   
yes i received one myself said dumbledore still smiling did you find it useful
not really
no i thought not you have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that i am indeed professor dumbledore and not an impostor
i didnt   harry began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not
for future reference harry it is raspberry   although of course if i were a death eater i would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself
er   right said harry well on that leaflet it said something about inferi what exactly are they the leaflet wasnt very clear
they are corpses said dumbledore calmly dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a dark wizards bidding inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since voldemort was last powerful    he killed enough people to make an army of them of course this is the place harry just here   
they were nearing a small neat stone house set in its own garden harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of inferi to have much attention left for anything else but as they reached the front gate dumbledore stopped dead and harry walked into him
oh dear oh dear dear dear
harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink the front door was hanging off its hinges
dumbledore glanced up and down the street it seemed quite deserted
wand out and follow me harry he said quietly
he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path harry at his heels then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready
lumos
dumbledores wand tip ignited casting its light up a narrow hallway to the left another door stood open holding his illuminated wand aloft dumbledore walked into the sitting room with harry right behind him
a scene of total devastation met their eyes a grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword a piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor the wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby cushions lay deflated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that its light was thrown upon the walls where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper harrys small intake of breath made dumbledore look around
not pretty is it he said heavily yes something horrible has happened here
dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet harry followed gazing around halfscared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body
maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off professor harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls
i dont think so said dumbledore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side
you mean hes — 
still here somewhere yes
and without warning dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair which yelled ouch
good evening horace said dumbledore straightening up again
harry’s jaw dropped where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye
there was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet it hurt
the wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas the top of his head barely reached dumbledores chin
what gave it away he grunted as he staggered to his feet still rubbing his lower belly he seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair
my dear horace said dumbledore looking amused if the death eaters really had come to call the dark mark would have been set over the house
the wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead
the dark mark he muttered knew there was something  ah well wouldnt have had time anyway id only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room
he heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter
would you like my assistance clearing up asked dumbledore politely
please said the other
they stood back to back the tall thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion
the furniture flew back to its original places ornaments reformed in midair feathers zoomed into their cushions torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rips cracks and holes healed everywhere and the walls wiped themselves clean
what kind of blood was that incidentally asked dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock
on the walls dragon shouted the wizard called horace as with a deafening grinding and tinkling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling
there was a final plunk from the piano and silence
yes dragon repeated the wizard conversationally my last bottle and prices are skyhigh at the moment still it might be reusable
he stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within
hmm bit dusty
he set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed it was then that his gaze fell upon harry
oho he said his large round eyes flying to harrys forehead and the lightningshaped scar it bore oho
this said dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction is harry potter harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine horace slughorn
slughorn turned on dumbledore his expression shrewd so thats how you thought youd persuade me is it well the answers no albus
he pushed past harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation
i suppose we can have a drink at least asked dumbledore for old times sake
slughorn hesitated
all right then one drink he said ungraciously
dumbledore smiled at harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp harry took the seat with the distinct impression that dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him as visible as possible certainly when slughorn who had been busy with decanters and glasses turned to face the room again his eyes fell immediately upon harry
hmpf he said looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes here — he gave a drink to dumbledore who had sat down without invitation thrust the tray at harry and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence his legs were so short they did not touch the floor
well how have you been keeping horace dumbledore asked
not so well said slughorn at once weak chest wheezy rheumatism too cant move like i used to well thats to be expected old age fatigue
and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice said dumbledore you cant have had more than three minutes warning
slughorn said half irritably half proudly two didnt hear my intruder charm go off i was taking a bath still he added sternly seeming to pull himself back together again the fact remains that im an old man albus a tired old man whos earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts
he certainly had those thought harry looking around the room it was stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable there were soft chairs and footstools drinks and books boxes of chocolates and plump cushions if harry had not known who lived there he would have guessed at a rich fussy old lady
youre not yet as old as i am horace said dumbledore
well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself said slughorn bluntly his pale gooseberry eyes had found dumbledores injured hand reactions not what they were i see
youre quite right said dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened ringers the sight of them made the back of harrys neck prickle unpleasantly one am undoubtedly slower than i was but on the other hand   
he shrugged and spread his hands wide as though to say that age had its compensations and harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen dumbledore wear before it was large rather clumsily made of what looked like gold and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle slughorns eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too and harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead
so all these precautions against intruders horace  are they for the death eaters benefit or mine asked dumbledore
what would the death eaters want with a poor brokendown old buffer like me demanded slughorn
i imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion torture and murder said dumbledore are you really telling me that they havent come recruiting yet
slughorn eyed dumbledore balefully for a moment then muttered i havent given them the chance ive been on the move for a year never stay in one place more than a week move from muggle house to muggle house — the owners of this place are on holiday in the canary islands — its been very pleasant ill be sorry to leave its quite easy once you know how one simple freezing charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors dont spot you bringing in the piano
ingenious said dumbledore but it sounds a rather tiring existence for a brokendown old buffer in search of a quiet life now if you were to return to hogwarts —
if youre going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath albus i might have been in hiding but some funny rumors have reached me since dolores umbridge left if thats how you treat teachers these days —
professor umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd said dumbledore i think you horace would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs filthy halfbreeds
thats what she did did she said slughorn idiotic woman never liked her
harry chuckled and both dumbledore and slughorn looked round at him
sorry harry said hastily its just — i didnt like her either
dumbledore stood up rather suddenly
are you leaving asked slughorn at once looking hopeful
no i was wondering whether i might use your bathroom said dumbledore
oh said slughorn clearly disappointed second on the left down the hall
dumbledore strode from the room once the door had closed behind him there was silence after a few moments slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself he shot a furtive look at harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming his wide behind
dont think i dont know why hes brought you he said abruptly
harry merely looked at slughorn slughorns watery eyes slid over harrys scar this time taking in the rest of his face
you look very like your father
yeah ive been told said harry
except for your eyes youve got —
my mothers eyes yeah harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing
hmpf yes well you shouldnt have favorites as a teacher of course but she was one of mine your mother slughorn added in answer to harry’s questioning look lily evans one of the brightest i ever taught vivacious you know charming girl i used to tell her she ought to have been in my house very cheeky answers i used to get back too 
which was your house
i was head of slytherin said slughorn oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on harrys face and wagging a stubby ringer at him dont go holding that against me youll be gryffindor like her i suppose yes it usually goes in families not always though ever heard of sirius black you must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks ago —
it was as though an invisible hand had twisted harrys intestines and held them tight
well anyway he was a big pal of your fathers at school the whole black family had been in my house but sirius ended up in gryffindor shame — he was a talented boy i got his brother regulus when he came along but id have liked the set
he sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction apparently lost in memories he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside
your mother was muggleborn of course couldnt believe it when i found out thought she must have been pureblood she was so good
one of my best friends is muggleborn said harry and shes the best in our year
funny how that sometimes happens isnt it said slughorn
not really said harry coldly
slughorn looked down at him in surprise you mustnt think im prejudiced he said no no no havent i just said your mother was one of my alltime favorite students and there was dirk cresswell in the year after her too — now head of the goblin liaison office of course — another muggleborn a very gifted student and still gives me excellent inside information on the goingson at gringotts
he bounced up and down a little smiling in a selfsatisfied way and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupants
all exstudents all signed youll notice barnabas cuffe editor of the daily prophet hes always interested to hear my take on the days news and ambrosius flume of honeydukes — a hamper every birthday and all because i was able to give him an introduction to ciceron harkisss who gave him his first job and at the back — youll see her if you just crane your neck — thats gwenog jones who of course captains the holyhead harpies    people are always astonished to hear im on firstname terms with the harpies and free tickets whenever i want them
this thought seemed to cheer him up enormously
and all these people know where to find you to send you stuff asked harry who could not help wondering why the death eaters had not yet tracked down slughorn if hampers of sweets quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him
the smile slid from slughorns face as quickly as the blood from his walls
of course not he said looking down at harry i have been out of touch with everybody for a year
harry had the impression that the words shocked slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment then he shrugged
still    the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times all very well for dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the order of the phoenix and while im sure theyre very admirable and brave and all the rest of it i dont personally fancy the mortality rate —
you dont have to join the order to teach at hogwarts said harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice it was hard to sympathize with slughorns cosseted existence when he remembered sirius crouching in a cave and living on rats most of the teachers arent in it and none of them has ever been killed — well unless you count quirrell and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with voldemort
harry had been sure slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear voldemorts name spoken aloud and was not disappointed slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which harry ignored
i reckon the staff are safer than most people while dumbledores headmaster hes supposed to be the only one voldemort ever feared isnt he harry went on
slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two he seemed to be thinking over harrys words
well yes it is true that hewhomustnotbenamed has never sought a fight with dumbledore he muttered grudgingly and i suppose one could argue that as i have not joined the death kilters hewhomustnotbenamed can hardly count me a friend    in which case i might well be safer a little closer to albus    i cannot pretend that amelia boness death did not shake me    if she with all her ministry contacts and protection   
dumbledore reentered the room and slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house
oh there you are albus he said youve been a very long lime upset stomach
no i was merely reading the muggle magazines said dumbledore i do love knitting patterns well harry we have trespassed upon horaces hospitality quite long enough i think it is time for us to leave
not at all reluctant to obey harry jumped to his feet slughorn sinned taken aback
youre leaving
yes indeed i think i know a lost cause when i see one
lost  
slughorn seemed agitated he twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak and harry zip up his jacket
well im sorry you dont want the job horace said dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to
yes    well    very gracious  as i say 
goodbye then
bye said harry
they were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them
all right all right ill do it
dumbledore turned to see slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room
you will come out of retirement
yes yes said slughorn impatiently i must be mad but yes
wonderful said dumbledore beaming then horace we shall see you on the first of september
yes i daresay you will grunted slughorn
as they set off down the garden path slughorns voice floated after them ill want a pay rise dumbledore
dumbledore chuckled the garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist
well done harry said dumbledore
i didnt do anything said harry in surprise
oh yes you did you showed horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to hogwarts did you like him
er
harry wasnt sure whether he liked slughorn or not he supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a muggleborn should make a good witch
horace said dumbledore relieving harry of the responsibility to say any of this likes his comfort he also likes the company of the famous the successful and the powerful he enjoys the feeling that he influences these people he has never wanted to occupy the throne himself he prefers the backseat — more room to spread out you see he used to handpick favorites at hogwarts somelimcs for their ambition or their brains sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center making introductions forging useful contacts between members and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the goblin liaison office
harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer
i tell you all this dumbledore continued not to turn you against horace — or as we must now call him professor slughorn — but to put you on your guard he will undoubtedly try to collect you harry you would be the jewel of his collection the boy who lived  or as they call you these days the chosen one
at these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over harry he was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him neither can live while the other survives   
dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier
this will do harry if you will grasp my arm
braced this time harry was ready for the apparition but still found it unpleasant when the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again he was standing in a country lane beside dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world the burrow in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it ron was in there    and so was mrs weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew   
if you dont mind harry said dumbledore as they passed through the gate id like a few words with you before we part in private perhaps in here
dumbledore pointed toward a rundown stone outhouse where the weasleys kept their broomsticks a little puzzled harry followed dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at harry
i hope you will forgive me for mentioning it harry but i am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the ministry permit me to say that i think sirius would have been proud of you
harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him he did not think he could stand to discuss sirius it had been painful enough to hear uncle vernon say his godfathers dead and even worse to hear sirius’s name thrown out casually by slughorn
it was cruel said dumbledore softly that you and sirius had such a short time together a brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship
harry nodded his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing dumbledores hat he could tell that dumbledore understood that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived harry had spent nearly all his time at the dursleys lying on his bed refusing meals and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness i hat he had come to associate with dementors
its just hard harry said finally in a low voice to realize he wont write to me again
his eyes burned suddenly and he blinked he felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside hogwarts who cared what happened to him almost like a parent had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather    and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again   
sirius represented much to you that you had never known before said dumbledore gently naturally the loss is devastating   
but while i was at the dursleys  interrupted harry his voice growing stronger i realized i can’t shut myself away or — or crack up sirius wouldnt have wanted that would he and anyway lifes too short    look at madam bones look at emmeline vance  it could be me next couldnt it but if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into dumbledores blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight ill make sure i take as many death eaters with me as i can and voldemort too if i can manage it
spoken both like your mother and fathers son and siriuss true godson said dumbledore with an approving pat on harrys back i take my hat off to you — or i would if i were not afraid of showering you in spiders
and now harry on a closely related subject i gather that you have been taking the daily prophet over the last two weeks
yes said harry and his heart beat a little faster
then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the hall of prophecy
yes said harry again and now everyone knows that im the one —
no they do not interrupted dumbledore there are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and lord voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom shed it is true however that many have guessed correctly that voldemort sent his death eaters to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you
now i think i am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said
no said harry
a wise decision on the whole said dumbledore although i think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger yes he continued when harry looked startled i think they ought to know you do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them
i didnt want —
— to worry or frighten them said dumbledore surveying harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles or perhaps to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened you need your friends harry as you so rightly said sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away
harry said nothing but dumbledore did not seem to require an answer he continued on a different though related subject it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year
private — with you said harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence
yes i think it is time that i took a greater hand in your education
what will you be teaching me sir
oh a little of this a little of that said dumbledore airily
harry waited hopefully but dumbledore did not elaborate so ho asked something else that had been bothering him slightly
if im having lessons with you i wont have to do occlumency lessons with snape will i
professor snape harry — and no you will not
good said harry in relief because they were a —
he stopped careful not to say what he really thought
i think the word fiasco would be a good one here said dumbledore nodding
harry laughed
well that means i wont see much of professor snape from now on he said because he wont let me carry on potions unless i get outstanding in my owl which i know i havent
dont count your owls before they are delivered said dumbledore gravely which now i think of it ought to be some time later today now two more things harry before we part
firstly i wish you to keep your invisibility cloak with you at all times from this moment onward even within hogwarts itself just in case you understand me
harry nodded
and lastly while you stay here the burrow has been given the highest security the ministry of magic can provide these measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to arthur and molly — all their post for instance is being searched at the ministry before being sent on they do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety however it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them
i understand said harry quickly
very well then said dumbledore pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard i see a light in the kitchen let us not deprive molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are

chapter five an excess of phlegm


harry and dumbledore approached the back door of the burrow which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old wellington boots and rusty cauldrons harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed dumbledore knocked three times and harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window
whos there said a nervous voice he recognized as mrs weasleys declare yourself
it is i dumbledore bringing harry
the door opened at once there stood mrs weasley short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown
harry dear gracious albus you gave me a fright you said not to expect you before morning
we were lucky said dumbledore ushering harry over the threshold slughorn proved much more persuadable than i had expected harrys doing of course ah hello nymphadora
harry looked around and saw that mrs weasley was not alone despite the lateness of the hour a young witch with a pale heartshaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands
hello professor she said  wotcher harry
hi tonks
harry thought she looked drawn even ill and there was something forced in her smile certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubblegumpink hair
id better be off she said quickly standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders thanks for the tea and sympathy molly
please dont leave on my account said dumbledore courteously i cannot stay i have urgent matters to discuss with rufus scrimgeour
no no i need to get going said tonks not meeting dumbledores eyes  night quot
dear why not come to dinner at the weekend remus and madeye are coming 
no really molly   thanks anyway   good night everyone
tonks hurried past dumbledore and harry into the yard a few paces beyond the doorstep she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air harry noticed that mrs weasley looked troubled
well i shall see you at hogwarts harry said dumbledore take care of yourself molly your servant
he made mrs weasley a bow and followed tonks vanishing at precisely the same spot mrs weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered harry by the shoulders into the full glow of ilu lantern on the table to examine his appearance
youre like ron she sighed looking him up and down both of you look as though youve had stretching jinxes put on you i nwcar rons grown four inches since i last bought him school robes are you hungry harry
yeah i am said harry suddenly realizing just how hungry he was
sit down dear ill knock something up
as harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled there purring
so hermiones here he asked happily as he tickled crookshanks behind the ears
oh yes she arrived the day before yesterday said mrs weasley rapping a large iron pot with her wand it bounced onto the itovc with a loud clang and began to bubble at once everyones in bed of course we didnt expect you for hours here you are quot
she tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward harry and tipped over mrs weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in lime to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup
bread dear
thanks mrs weasley
she waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table as the loaf sliced itself and llie soup pot dropped back onto the stove mrs weasley sat down opposite him
so you persuaded horace slughorn to take the job
harry nodded his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak
he taught arthur and me said mrs weasley he was at hogwarts for ages started around the same time as dumbledore i think did you like him
his mouth now full of bread harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head
i know what you mean said mrs weasley nodding wisely of course he can be charming when he wants to be but arthurs never liked him much the ministrys littered with slughorns old favorites he was always good at giving leg ups but he never had much time for arthur didnt seem to think he was enough of a highflier well that just shows you even slughorn makes mistakes i dont know whether rons told you in any of his letters its only just happened but arthurs been promoted
it could not have been clearer that mrs weasley had been bursting to say this
harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering thats great he gasped
you are sweet beamed mrs weasley possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news yes rufus scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation and arthurs heading the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects its a big job hes got ten people reporting to him now
what exactly 
well you see in all the panic about youknowwho odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere things that are supposed to guard against youknowwho and the death eaters you can imagine the kind of thing socalled protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off    well in the main the perpetrators are just people like mundungus hotelier whove never done an honest days work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is but every now and then something really nasty turns up the other day arthur confiscated a box of cursed sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a death eater so you see its a very important job and i tell him its just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and loasters and all the rest of that muggle rubbish mrs weasley ended her speech with a stern look as if it had been harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs
is mr weasley still at work harry asked
yes he is as a matter of fact hes a tiny bit late  he said hed be back around midnight   
she turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table harry recognized it at once it had nine hands each inscribed with the name of a family member and usually hung on i he weasleys sitting room wall though its current position suggested that mrs weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at mortal peril
its been like that for a while now said mrs weasley in an unconvincingly casual voice ever since youknowwho came back into the open i suppose everybodys in mortal danger now  i dont think it can be just our family    but i dont know anyone else whos got a clock like this so i cant check oh
with a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clocks face mr weasleys hand had switched to traveling
hes coming
and sure enough a moment later there was a knock on the back door mrs weasley jumped up and hurried to it with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly arthur is that you
yes came mr weasleys weary voice but i would say that even if i were a death eater dear ask the question
oh honestly
molly
all right all right   what is your dearest ambition
to find out how airplanes stay up
mrs weasley nodded and turned the doorknob but apparently mr weasley was holding tight to it on the other side because the door remained firmly shut
molly ive got to ask you your question first
arthur really this is just silly 
what do you like me to call you when were alone together
even by the dim light of the lantern harry could tell that mrs weasley had turned bright red he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck and hastily gulped soup clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl
mollywobbles whispered a mortified mrs weasley into the crack at the edge of the door
correct said mr weasley now you can let me in
mrs weasley opened the door to reveal her husband a thin balding redhaired wizard wearing hornrimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak
i still dont see why we have to go through that every time you come home said mrs weasley still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak i mean a death eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you
i know dear but its ministry procedure and i have to set an example something smells good onion soup
mr weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table
harry we didnt expect you until morning
they shook hands and mr weasley dropped into the chair beside harry as mrs weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too
thanks molly its been a tough night some idiots started selling metamorphmedals just sling them around your neck and youll be able to change your appearance at will a hundred thousand disguises all for ten galleons
and what really happens when you put them on
mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle like warts all over their bodies as if st mungos didnt have enough to do already
it sounds like the sort of thing fred and george would find funny said mrs weasley hesitantly are you sure 
of course i am said mr weasley the boys wouldnt do anything like that now not when people are desperate for protection
so is that why youre late metamorphmedals
no we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in elephant and castle but luckily the magical law enforcement squad had sorted it out by the time we got there 
harry stifled a yawn behind his hand
bed said an undeceived mrs weasley at once ive got fred and georges room all ready for you youll have it to yourself
why where are they
oh theyre in diagon alley sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as theyre so busy said mrs weasley i must say i didnt approve at first but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business come on dear your trunks already up there
night mr weasley said harry pushing back his chair crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room
gnight harry said mr weasley
harry saw mrs weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen all the hands were once again at mortal peril
fred and georges bedroom was on the second floor mrs weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what harry thought was gunpowder a considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard boxes amongst which stood harrys school trunk the room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse
hedwig hooted happily at harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting harry bade mrs weasley good night put on pajamas and got into one of the beds there was something hard inside the pillowcase he groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purpleandorange sweet which he recognized as a puking pastille smiling to himself he rolled over and was instantly asleep
seconds later or so it seemed to harry he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open sitting bolt upright he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back the dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes shielding them with one hand he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other
wuzzgoinon
we didnt know you were here already said a loud and excited voice and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head
ron dont hit him said a girls voice reproachfully
harrys hand found his glasses and he shoved them on though i he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway a long looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment he blinked and ron weasley came into focus grinning down at him
all right
never been better said harry rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows you
not bad said ron pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it when did you get here mums only just told us
about one oclock this morning
were the muggles all right did they treat you okay
same as usual said harry as hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed they didnt talk to me much but i like it better that way howre you hermione
oh im fine said hermione who was scrutinizing harry as though he was sickening for something he thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss siriuss death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said whats the time have i missed breakfast
dont worry about that mums bringing you up a tray she reckons you look underfed said ron rolling his eyes so whats been going on
nothing much ive just been stuck at my aunt and uncles havent i
come off it said ron youve been off with dumbledore
it wasnt that exciting he just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement his names horace slughorn
oh said ron looking disappointed we thought quot
hermione flashed a warning look at ron and ron changed tack at top speed
—we thought itd be something like that
you did said harry amused
yeah    yeah now umbridge has left obviously we need a new defense against the dark arts teacher dont we so er whats he like
he looks a bit like a walrus and he used to be head of slytherin said harry something wrong hermione
she was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment she rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile
no of course not so um did slughorn seem like hell be a good teacher
dunno said harry he cant be worse than umbridge can he
i know someone whos worse than umbridge said a voice from the doorway rons younger sister slouched into the room looking irritable hi harry
whats up with you ron asked
its her said ginny plonking herself down on harrys bed shes driving me mad
whats she done now asked hermione sympathetically
its the way she talks to me youd think i was about three
i know said hermione dropping her voice shes so full of herself
harry was astonished to hear hermione talking about mrs weasley like this and could not blame ron for saying angrily cant you two lay off her for five seconds
oh thats right defend her snapped ginny we all know you cant get enough of her
this seemed an odd comment to make about rons mother starting to feel that he was missing something harry said who are you 
but his question was answered before he could finish it the bedroom door flew open again and harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that hermione and ginny slid off the bed onto the floor
a young woman was standing in the doorway a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless she was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint silvery glow to complete this vision of perfection she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray
arry she said in a throaty voice eet as been too long
as she swept over the threshold toward him mrs weasley was revealed bobbing along in her wake looking rather cross
there was no need to bring up the tray i was just about to do it myself
eet was no trouble said fleur delacour setting the tray across harrys knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek he felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn i ave been longing to see itn you remember my seester gabrielle she never stops talking about arry potter she will be delighted to see you again
oh  is she here too harry croaked
no no silly boy said fleur with a tinkling laugh i mean next summer when we but do you not know
her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at mrs weasley who said we hadnt got around to telling him yet
fleur turned back to harry swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped mrs weasley across the face
bill and i are going to be married
oh said harry blankly he could not help noticing how mrs weasley hermione and ginny were all determinedly avoiding one anothers gaze wow er congratulations
she swooped down upon him and kissed him again
bill is very busy at ze moment working very ard and i only work parttime at gringotts for my eenglish so he brought me ere for a few days to get to know is family properly i was so pleased to ear you would be coming zere isnt much to do ere unless you like cooking and chickens well enjoy your breakfast arry
with these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her
mrs weasley made a noise that sounded like tchah
mum hates her said ginny quietly
i do not hate her said mrs weasley in a cross whisper i just think theyve hurried into this engagement thats all
theyve known each other a year said ron who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door
well thats not very long i know why its happened of course its all this uncertainty with youknowwho coming back people think they might be dead tomorrow so theyre rushing all sorts of decisions theyd normally take time over it was the same last time he was powerful people eloping left right and center quot
including you and dad said ginny slyly
yes well your father and i were made for each other what was the point in waiting said mrs weasley whereas bill and fleur    well   what have they really got in common hes a hardworking downtoearth sort of person whereas shes quot
a cow said ginny nodding but bills not that downtoearth hes a cursebreaker isnt he he likes a bit of adventure a bit of glamour  i expect thats why hes gone for phlegm
stop calling her that ginny said mrs weasley sharply as harry and hermione laughed well id better get on  eat your eggs while theyre warm harry
looking careworn she left the room ron still seemed slightly punchdrunk he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water
dont you get used to her if shes staying in the same house harry asked
well you do said ron but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly like then 
its pathetic said hermione furiously striding away from ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall
you dont really want her around forever ginny asked ron incredulously when he merely shrugged she said well mums going to put a stop to it if she can i bet you anything
hows she going to manage that asked harry
she keeps trying to get tonks round for dinner i think shes hoping bill will fall for tonks instead i hope he does id much rather have her in the family
yeah thatll work said ron sarcastically listen no bloke in his right minds going to fancy tonks when fleurs around i mean tonks is okaylooking when she isnt doing stupid things to her hair and her nose but quot
shes a damn sight nicer than phlegm said ginny
and shes more intelligent shes an auror said hermione from the corner
fleurs not stupid she was good enough to enter the triwizard tournament said harry
not you as well said hermione bitterly
i suppose you like the way phlegm says  any do you asked ginny scornfully
no said harry wishing he hadnt spoken i was just saying phlegm i mean fleur quot
id much rather have tonks in the family said ginny at least shes a laugh
she hasnt been much of a laugh lately said ron every time ive seen her shes looked more like moaning myrtle
thats not fair snapped hermione she still hasnt got over what happened    you know  i mean he was her cousin
harrys heart sank they had arrived at sirius he picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation
tonks and sirius barely knew each other said ron sirius was in azkaban half her life and before that their families never met quot
thats not the point said hermione she thinks it was her limit he died
how does she work that one out asked harry in spite of himself
well she was fighting bellatrix lestrange wasnt she i think she feels that if only she had finished her off bellatrix couldnt have killed sirius
thats stupid said ron
its survivors guilt said hermione i know lupins tried to talk her round but shes still really down shes actually having trouble with her metamorphosing
with her 
she cant change her appearance like she used to explained hermione i think her powers must have been affected by shock or something
i didnt know that could happen said harry
nor did i said hermione but i suppose if youre really depressed 
the door opened again and mrs weasley popped her head in ginny she whispered come downstairs and help me with the lunch
im talking to this lot said ginny outraged
now said mrs weasley and withdrew
she only wants me there so she doesnt have to be alone with phlegm said ginny crossly she swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina
you lot had better come down quickly too she said as she left
harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast hermione was peering into fred and georges boxes though every now and then she cast sideways looks at harry ron who was now helping himself to harry’s toast was still gazing dreamily at the door
whats this hermione asked eventually holding up what looked like a small telescope
dunno said ron but if fred and georgeve left it here its probably not ready for the joke shop yet so be careful
your mum said the shops going well said harry said fred and george have got a real flair for business
thats an understatement said ron theyre raking in the galleons i cant wait to see the place we havent been to diagon alley yet because mum says dads got to be there for extra security and hes been really busy at work but it sounds excellent
and what about percy asked harry the thirdeldest weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family is he talking to your mum and dad again
nope said ron
but he knows your dad was right all along now about voldemort being back quot
dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right said hermione i heard him telling your mum ron
sounds like the sort of mental thing dumbledore would say said ron
hes going to be giving me private lessons this year said harry conversationally
ron choked on his bit of toast and hermione gasped
you kept that quiet said ron
i only just remembered said harry honestly he told me last night in your broom shed
blimey    private lessons with dumbledore said ron looking impressed i wonder why hes    
his voice tailed away harry saw him and hermione exchange looks harry laid down his knife and fork his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed dumbledore had said to do it  why not now he fixed his eyes on his fork which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap and said i dont know exactly why hes going to be giving me lessons but i think it must be because of the prophecy
neither ron nor hermione spoke harry had the impression that both had frozen he continued still speaking to his fork you know the one they were trying to steal at the ministry
nobody knows what it said though said hermione quickly it got smashed
although the prophet says quot began ron but hermione said shh
the prophets got it right said harry looking up at them both with a great effort hermione seemed frightened and ron amazed that glass ball that smashed wasnt the only record of the prophecy i heard the whole thing in dumbledores office he was the one the prophecy was made to so he could tell me from what it said harry took a deep breath it looks like im the one whos got to finish off voldemort  at least it said neither of us could live while the other survives
the three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment then there was a loud bang and hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke
hermione shouted harry and ron the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash
hermione emerged coughing out of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye
i squeezed it and it it punched me she gasped
and sure enough they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope
dont worry said ron who was plainly trying not to laugh mumll fix that shes good at healing minor injuries quot
oh well never mind that now said hermione hastily harry oh harry  
she sat down on the edge of his bed again
we wondered after we got back from the ministry    obviously we didnt want to say anything to you but from what lucius malfoy said about the prophecy how it was about you and voldemort well we thought it might be something like this    oh harry    she stared at him then whispered are you scared
not as much as i was said harry when i first heard it i was    but now it seems as though i always knew id have to face him in the end   
when we heard dumbledore was collecting you in person we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy said ron eagerly and we were kind of right werent we he wouldnt be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner wouldnt waste his time he must think youve got a chance
thats true said hermione one wonder what hell teach you harry really advanced defensive magic probably   powerful countercurses    antijinxes   
harry did not really listen a warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving he knew that ron and hermione were more shocked than they were letting on but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him speaking bracing words of comfort not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous was worth more than he could ever tell them
and evasive enchantments generally concluded hermione well at least you know one lesson youll be having this year thats one more than ron and me i wonder when our owl results will come
cant be long now its been a month said ron
hang on said harry as another part of last nights conversation came back to him i think dumbledore said our owl results would be arriving today
today shrieked hermione today but why didnt you oh my god you should have said quot
she leapt to her feet
im going to see whether any owls have come 
but when harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray it was to find hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation while mrs weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda
it just wont budge mrs weasley was saying anxiously standing over hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of the healers helpmate open at bruises cuts and abrasions this has always worked before i just cant understand it
itll be fred and georges idea of a funny joke making sure it cant come off said ginny
but its got to come off squeaked hermione i cant go around looking like this forever
you wont dear well find an antidote dont worry said mrs weasley soothingly
bill told me w fred and george are very amusing said fleur smiling serenely
yes i can hardly breathe for laughing snapped hermione
she jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen twisting her fingers together
mrs weasley youre quite quite sure no owls have arrived this morning
yes dear id have noticed said mrs weasley patiently but its barely nine theres still plenty of time   
i know i messed up ancient runes muttered hermione feverishly i definitely made at least one serious mistranslation and the defense against the dark arts practical was no good at all i thought transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back quot
hermione will you shut up youre not the only one whos nervous barked ron and when youve got your eleven outstanding oils  
dont dont dont said hermione flapping her hands hysterically i know ive failed everything
what happens if we fail harry asked the room at large but it was again hermione who answered
we discuss our options with our head of house i asked professor mcgonagall at the end of last term
harrys stomach squirmed he wished he had eaten less breakfast
at beauxbatons said fleur complacently we ad a different way of doing things i think eet was better we sat our examinations after six years of study not five and then quot
fleurs words were drowned in a scream hermione was pointing through the kitchen window three black specks were clearly visible in the sky growing larger all the time
theyre definitely owls said ron hoarsely jumping up to join hermione at the window
and there are three of them said harry hastening to her other side
one for each of us said hermione in a terrified whisper oh no  oh no  oh no 
she gripped both harry and ron tightly around the elbows
the owls were flying directly at the burrow three handsome tawnies each of which it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house was carrying a large square envelope
oh no squealed hermione
mrs weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window one two three the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line all three of them lifted their right legs
harry moved forward the letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle he untied it with fumbling fingers to his left ron was trying to detach his own results to his right hermiones hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble
nobody in the kitchen spoke at last harry managed to detach the envelope he slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside
ordinary wizarding level results

harry read the parchment through several times his breathing becoming easier with each reading it was all right he had always known that he would fail divination and he had had no chance of passing history of magic given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination but he had passed everything else he ran his finger down the grades    he had passed well in transfiguration and herbology he had even exceeded expectations at potions and best of all he had achieved outstanding at defense against the dark arts
he looked around hermione had her back to him and her head bent but ron was looking delighted
only failed divination and history of magic and who cares about them he said happily to harry here swap quot
harry glanced down rons grades there were no outstandings there   
knew youd be top at defense against the dark arts said ron punching harry on the shoulder weve done all right havent we
well done said mrs weasley proudly ruffling rons hair seven owls thats more than fred and george got together
hermione said ginny tentatively for hermione still hadnt turned around how did you do
inot bad said hermione in a small voice
oh come off it said ron striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand yep ten outstandings and one exceeds expectations at defense against the dark arts he looked down at her halfamused halfexasperated youre actually disappointed arent you
hermione shook her head but harry laughed
well were newt students now grinned ron mum are there any more sausages
harry looked back down at his results they were as good as he could have hoped for he felt just one tiny twinge of regret    this was the end of his ambition to become an auror he had not secured the required potions grade he had known all along that he wouldnt but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black e
it was odd really seeing that it had been a death eater in disguise who had first told harry he would make a good auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he couldnt really think of anything else he would like to be moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago    neither can live while the other survives   wouldnt he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill voldemort

chapter six dracos detour


harry remained within the confines of the burrows garden over the next few weeks he spent most of his days playing twoaside quidditch in the weasleys orchard he and hermione against ron and ginny hermione was dreadful and ginny good so they were reasonably well matched and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything mrs weasley put in front of him 
  
it would have been a happy peaceful holiday had it not been for the stones of disappearances odd accidents even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the prophet sometimes bill and mr weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper to mrs weasley’s displeasure harrys sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by remus lupin who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever 
  
there have been another couple of dementor attacks he announced as mrs weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake and theyve found igor karkaroffs body in a shack up north the dark mark had been set over it — well frankly im surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the death eaters siriuss brother regulus only managed a few days as far as i can remember 
  
yes well said mrs weasley frowning perhaps we should talk about something diff— 
  
did you hear about florean fortescue remus asked bill who was being plied with wine by fleur the man who ran — 
  
— the icecream place in diagon alley harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach he used to give me free ice creams whats happened to him 
  
dragged off by the look of his place 
  
why asked ron while mrs weasley pointedly glared at bill 
  
who knows he mustve upset them somehow he was a good man florean 
  
talking of diagon alley said mr weasley looks like ollivanders gone too 
  
the wandmaker said ginny looking startled 
  
thats the one shops empty no sign of a struggle no one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped 
  
but wands — whatll people do for wands 
  
theyll make do with other makers said lupin but ollivander was the best and if the other side have got him its not so good for us 
  
the day after this rather gloomy birthday tea their letters and booklists arrived from hogwarts harrys included a surprise he had been made quidditch captain 
  
that gives you equal status with prefects cried hermione happily you can use our special bathroom now and everything 
  
wow i remember when charlie wore one of these said ron examining the badge with glee harry this is so cool youre my captain — if you let me back on the team i suppose ha ha    
  
well i dont suppose we can put off a trip to diagon alley much longer now youve got these sighed mrs weasley looking down ron’s booklist well go on saturday as long as your father doesnt have to go into work again im not going there without him 
  
mum dyou honestly think youknowwhos going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in flourish and blotts sniggered ron 
  
fortescue and ollivander went on holiday did they said mrs weasley firing up at once if you think securitys a laughing matter you can stay behind and ill get your things myself— 
  
no i wanna come i want to see fred and georges shop said ron hastily 
  
then you just buck up your ideas young man before i decide youre too immature to come with us said mrs weasley angrily snatching up her clock all nine hands of which were still pointing at mortal peril and balancing it on top of a pile of justlaundered towels and that goes for returning to hogwarts as well 
  
ron turned to stare incredulously at harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room 
  
blimey   you cant even make a joke round here anymore    
  
but ron was careful not to be flippant about voldemort over the next few days saturday dawned without any more outbursts from mrs weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast bill who 
  
would be staying at home with fleur much to hermione and ginnys pleasure passed a full money bag across the table to harry 
  
wheres mine demanded ron at once his eyes wide 
  
thats already harrys idiot said bill i got it out of your vault for you harry because its taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much two days ago arkie philpott had a probity probe stuck up his  well trust me this ways easier 
  
thanks bill said harry pocketing his gold 
  
e is always so thoughtful purred fleur adoringly stroking bills nose ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind fleur harry choked over his cornflakes and ron thumped him on the back 
  
it was an overcast murky day one of the special ministry of magic cars in which harry had ridden once before was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks 
  
its good dad can get us these again said ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the burrow bill and fleur waving from the kitchen window he harry hermione and ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat 
  
dont get used to it its only because of harry said mr weasley over his shoulder he and mrs weasley were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a twoseater sofa hes been given topgrade security status and well be joining up with additional security at the leaky cauldron too 
  
harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping 
  
while surrounded by a battalion of aurors he had stowed his invisibility cloak in his backpack and felt that if that was good enough for dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the ministry though now he came to think of it he was not sure the ministry knew about his cloak 
  
here you are then said the driver a surprisingly short while later speaking for the first time as he slowed in charing cross road and stopped outside the leaky cauldron im to wait for you any idea how long youll be 
  
a couple of hours i expect said mr weasley ah good hes here 
  
harry imitated mr weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt there were no aurors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic blackbearded form of rubeus hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of harrys face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing muggles 
  
harry he boomed sweeping harry into a bonecrushing hug the moment harry had stepped out of the car buckbeak — witherwings i mean — yeh should see him harry hes so happy ter be back in the open air — 
  
glad hes pleased said harry grinning as he massaged his ribs we didnt know security meant you 
  
i know jus like old times innit see the ministry wanted ter send a bunch o aurors but dumbledore said id do said hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets lets get goin then — after yeh molly arthur — 
  
the leaky cauldron was for the first time in harrys memory completely empty only tom the landlord wizened and toothless 
  
remained of the old crowd he looked up hopefully as they entered but before he could speak hagrid said importantly jus passin through today tom sure yeh understand hogwarts business yeh know 
  
tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses harry hermione hagrid and the weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street they stepped through the entrance and paused looking around 
  
diagon alley had changed the colorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large ministry of magic posters that had been pasted over them most of these somber purple posters carried blownup versions of the security advice on the ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving blackandwhite photographs of death eaters known to be on the loose bellatrix lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary a few windows were boarded up including those of florean fortescues ice cream parlor on the other hand a number of shabbylooking stalls had sprung up along the street the nearest one which had been erected outside flourish and blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front 
  
amulets 
  
effective against werewolves dement on and infer 
  
a seedylooking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby 
  
one for your little girl madam he called at mrs weasley as they passed leering at ginny protect her pretty neck 
  
if i were on duty    said mr weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller 
  
yes but dont go arresting anyone now dear were in a hurry said mrs weasley nervously consulting a list i think wed better do madam malkins first hermione wants new dress robes and rons showing much too much ankle in his school robes and you must need new ones too harry youve grown so much — come on everyone — 
  
molly it doesnt make sense for all of us to go to madam malkins said mr weasley why dont those three go with hagrid and we can go to flourish and blotts and get everyones schoolbooks 
  
i dont know said mrs weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack hagrid do you think —  
  
don fret theyll be fine with me molly said hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid mrs weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and ginny while harry ron hermione and hagrid set off for madam malkins 
  
harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried anxious look as mrs weasley and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups moving intently about their business nobody seemed to be shopping alone 
  
migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us said hagrid stopping outside madam malkins and bending down to peer through the window ill stand guard outside all right 
  
so harry ron and hermione entered the little shop together it appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue 
  
   not a child in case you havent noticed mother i am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone 
  
there was a clucking noise and a voice harry recognized as that of madam malkin the owner said now dear your mothers quite right none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore its nothing to do with being a child — 
  
watch where youre sticking that pin will you 
  
a teenage boy with a pale pointed face and whiteblond hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves he strode to the mirror and examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed harry ron and hermione reflected over his shoulder his light gray eyes narrowed 
  
if youre wondering what the smell is mother a mudblood just walked in said draco malfoy 
  
i dont think theres any need for language like that said madam malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand and i dont want wands drawn in my shop either she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her harry and ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at malfoy hermione who was standing slightly behind them whispered no dont honestly its not worth it  
  
yeah like youd dare do magic out of school sneered malfoy who blacked your eye granger i want to send them flowers 
  
thats quite enough said madam malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for support madam — please — 
  
narcissa malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack 
  
put those away she said coldly to harry and ron if you attack my son again i shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do 
  
really said harry taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all its pallor still resembled her sisters he was as tall as she was now going to get a few death eater pals to do us in are you 
  
madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart 
  
really you shouldnt accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away please 
  
but harry did not lower his wand narcissa malfoy smiled unpleasantly 
  
i see that being dumbledores favorite has given you a false sense of security harry potter but dumbledore wont always be there to protect you 
  
harry looked mockingly all around the shop wow   look at that   hes not here now so why not have a go they might be able to find you a double cell in azkaban with your loser of a husband 
  
malfoy made an angry movement toward harry but stumbled over his overlong robe ron laughed loudly 
  
dont you dare talk to my mother like that potter malfoy snarled 
  
its all right draco said narcissa restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder i expect potter will be reunited with dear sirius before i am reunited with lucius  
  
harry raised his wand higher 
  
harry no moaned hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side think    you mustnt    youll be in such trouble  
  
madam malkin dithered for a moment on the spot then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldnt she bent toward malfoy who was still glaring at harry 
  
i think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more dear let me just — 
  
ouch bellowed malfoy slapping her hand away watch where youre putting your pins woman mother — i dont think i want these anymore — 
  
he pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at madam malkins feet 
  
youre right draco said narcissa with a contemptuous glance at hermione now i know the kind of scum that shops here    well do better at twilfitt and tattings 
  
and with that the pair of them strode out of the shop malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into ron on the way out 
  
well really said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust 
  
she was distracted all through the fitting of rons and harrys new robes tried to sell hermione wizards dress robes instead of witchs and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them 
  
got evrything asked hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side 
  
just about said harry did you see the malfoys 
  
yeah said hagrid unconcerned bu they wouldn’ dare make trouble in the middle o diagon alley harry don worry abouone them 
  
harry ron and hermione exchanged looks but before they could disabuse hagrid of this comfortable notion mr and mrs weasley and ginny appeared all clutching heavy packages of books 
  
everyone all right said mrs weasley got your robes right then we can pop in at the apothecary and eeylops on the way to fred and georges — stick close now    
  
neither harry nor ron bought any ingredients at the apothecary seeing that they were no longer studying potions but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for hedwig and pigwidgeon at eeylops owl emporium then with mrs weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed farther along the street in search of weasleys wizard wheezes the joke shop run by fred and george 
  
we really havent got too long mrs weasley said so well just have a quick look around and then back to the car we must be close thats number ninetytwo    ninetyfour    
  
whoasaid ron stopping in his tracks 
  
set against the dull postermuffled shop fronts around them fred and georges windows hit the eye like a firework display casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows and a few rather stunnedlooking people had actually come to a halt transfixed the lefthand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked harrys eyes began to water just looking at it the righthand window was covered with a gigantic poster purple like those of the ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters 
  
why are you worrying about 
youknowwho 
you should be worrying about 
unopoo 
the constipation sensation 
thats gripping the nation 
  
harry started to laugh he heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see mrs weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster her lips moved silently mouthing the name unopoo 
  
theyll be murdered in their beds she whispered 
  
no they won’t said ron who like harry was laughing this is brilliant 
  
and he and harry led the way into the shop it was packed with customers harry could not get near the shelves he stared around looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling here were the skiving snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last unfinished year at hogwarts harry noticed that the nosebleed nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf there were bins full of trick wands the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in selfinking spellchecking and smartanswer varieties a space cleared in the crowd and harry pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted tenyearolds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangman — spell it or hell swing 
  
patented daydream charms 
  
hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship 
  
one simple incantation and you will enter a topquality highly realistic thirtyminute daydream easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling not for sale to undersixteens you know said hermione looking up at harry that really is extraordinary magic 
  
for that hermione said a voice behind them you can have one for free 
  
a beaming fred stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair 
  
how are you harry they shook hands and whats happened to your eye hermione 
  
your punching telescope she said ruefully 
  
oh blimey i forgot about those said fred here — 
  
he pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste 
  
just dab it on that bruisell be gone within the hour said fred we had to find a decent bruise remover were testing most of our products on ourselves 
  
hermione looked nervous it is safe isnt it she asked 
  
course it is said fred bracingly come on harry ill give you a tour 
  
harry left hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed fred toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks 
  
muggle magic tricks said fred happily pointing them out for freaks like dad you know who love muggle stuff its not a big earner but we do fairly steady business theyre great novelties    oh heres george  
  
freds twin shook harrys hand energetically 
  
giving him the tour come through the back harry thats where were making the real money—pocket anything you and youll pay in more than galleons he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark 
  
markstheyll make anyone sick 
  
george pushed back a curtain beside the muggle tricks and harry saw a darker less crowded room the packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued 
  
weve just developed this more serious line said fred funny how it happened    
  
you wouldnt believe how many people even people who work at the ministry cant do a decent shield charm said george course they didnt have you teaching them harry 
  
thats right    well we thought shield hats were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off but the ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff and were still getting massive orders 
  
so weve expanded into a range of shield cloaks shield gloves  
  
 i mean they wouldnt help much against the unforgivable curses but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes    
  
and then we thought wed get into the whole area of defense against the dark arts because its such a money spinner continued george enthusiastically this is cool look instant darkness powder were importing it from peru handy if you want to make 
  
a quick escape 
  
and our decoy detonators are just walking off the shelves look said fred pointing at a number of weirdlooking black horntype objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight you just drop one surreptitiously and itll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a diversion if you need one 
  
handy said harry impressed 
  
here said george catching a couple and throwing them to harry 
  
a young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes 
  
theres a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron mr weasley and mr weasley she said 
  
harry found it very odd to hear fred and george called mr weasley but they took it in their stride 
  
right you are verity im coming said george promptly harry you help yourself to anything you want all right no charge 
  
i cant do that said harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the decoy detonators 
  
you dont pay here said fred firmly waving away harrys gold 
  
but— 
  
you gave us our startup loan we havent forgotten said george sternly take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask 
  
george swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and fred led harry back into the main part of the shop to find hermione and ginny still poring over the patented daydream charms 
  
havent you girls found our special wonderwitch products yet asked fred follow me ladies    
  
near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically hermione and ginny both hung back looking wary 
  
there you go said fred proudly best range of love potions youll find anywhere 
  
ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically do they work she asked 
  
certainly they work for up to twentyfour hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question — 
  
— and the attractiveness of the girl said george reappearing suddenly at their side but were not selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when shes already got about five boys on the go from what weve — 
  
whatever youve heard from ron is a big fat lie said ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf whats this 
  
guaranteed tensecond pimple vanisher said fred excellent on everything from boils to blackheads but dont change the subject are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called dean thomas 
  
yes i am said ginny and last time i looked he was definitely one boy not five what are those 
  
she was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting highpitched squeaks 
  
pygmy puffs said george miniature puffskeins we can’t breed them fast enough so what about michael corner 
  
i dumped him he was a bad loser said ginny putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the pygmy puffs crowd around it theyre really cute 
  
theyre fairly cuddly yes conceded fred but youre moving through boyfriends a bit fast arent you 
  
ginny turned to look at him her hands on her hips there was such a mrs weasleyish glare on her face that harry was surprised fred didnt recoil 
  
its none of your business and ill thank you she added angrily to ron who had just appeared at georges elbow laden with merchandise not to tell tales about me to these two 
  
thats three galleons nine sickles and a knut said fred examining the many boxes in rons arms cough up 
  
im your brother 
  
and thats our stuff youre nicking three galleons nine sickles ill knock off the knut 
  
but i havent got three galleons nine sickles 
  
youd better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelves 
  
ron dropped several boxes swore and made a rude hand gesture at fred that was unfortunately spotted by mrs weasley who had chosen that moment to appear 
  
if i see you do that again ill jinx your fingers together she said sharply 
  
mum can i have a pygmy puff said ginny at once 
  
a what said mrs weasley warily 
  
look theyre so sweet    
  
mrs weasley moved aside to look at the pygmy puffs and harry ron and hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window draco malfoy was hurrying up the street alone as he passed weasleys wizard wheezes he glanced over his shoulder seconds later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him 
  
wonder where his mummy is said harry frowning 
  
given her the slip by the looks of it said ron 
  
why though said hermione 
  
harry said nothing he was thinking too hard narcissa malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches 
  
harry knowing and loathing malfoy was sure the reason could not be innocent 
  
he glanced around mrs weasley and ginny were bending over the pygmy puffs mr weasley was delightedly examining a pack of muggle marked playing cards fred and george were both helping customers on the other side of the glass hagrid was standing with his back to them looking up and down the street 
  
get under here quick said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag 
  
oh — i dont know harry said hermione looking uncertainly toward mrs weasley 
  
come on said ron 
  
she hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with harry and ron nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in fred and georges products harry ron and hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could but by the time they gained the street malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had 
  
he was going in that direction murmured harry as quietly as possible so that the humming hagrid would not hear them “cmon” 
  
they scurried along peering left and right through shop windows and doors until hermione pointed ahead 
  
thats him isnt it she whispered turning left 
  
big surprise whispered ron 
  
for malfoy had glanced around then slid into knockturn alley and out of sight 
  
quick or well lose him said harry speeding up 
  
our feetil be seen said hermionc anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays 
  
it doesnt matter said harry impatiently just hurry 
  
but knockturn alley the side street devoted to the dark arts looked completely deserted they peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy dark artifacts — or at least to be seen buying them 
  
hermione gave his arm a hard pinch 
  
ouch 
  
shh look hes in there she breathed in harrys ear 
  
they had drawn level with the only shop in knockturn alley that harry had ever visited borgin and burkes which sold a wide variety of sinister objects there in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood draco malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which harry had once hidden to avoid malfoy and his father judging by the movements of malfoys hands he was talking animatedly the proprietor of the shop mr borgin an oilyhaired stooping man stood facing malfoy he was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear 
  
if only we could hear what theyre saying said hermione 
  
we can said ron excitedly hang on — damn — 
  
he dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest 
  
extendable ears look 
  
fantastic said hermione as ron unraveled the long flesh 
  
colored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door oh i hope the door isnt imperturbable — 
  
no said ron gleefully listen 
  
they put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings through which malfoys voice could be heard loud and clear as though a radio had been turned on 
  
   you know how to fix it 
  
possibly said borgin in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself ill need to see it though why dont you bring it into the shop 
  
i cant said malfoy its got to stay put i just need you to tell me how to do it 
  
harry saw borgin lick his lips nervously 
  
well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible i couldnt guarantee anything 
  
no said malfoy and harry knew just by his tone that malfoy was sneering perhaps this will make you more confident 
  
he moved toward borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet harry ron and hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see was borgin looking very frightened 
  
tell anyone said maifoy and there will be retribution you know fenrir greyback hes a family friend hell be dropping in from time to time to make sure youre giving the problem your full attention 
  
there will be no need for — 
  
ill decide that said malfoy well id better be off and dont forget to keep that one safe ill need it 
  
perhaps youd like to take it now 
  
no of course i wouldnt you stupid little man how would i look carrying that down the street just dont sell it 
  
of course not   sir 
  
borgin made a bow as deep as the one harry had once seen him give lucius malfoy 
  
not a word to anyone borgin and that includes my mother understand 
  
naturally naturally murmured borgin bowing again 
  
next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly as malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself he passed so close to harry ron and hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again inside the shop borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried 
  
what was that about whispered ron reeling in the extendable ears 
  
dunno said harry thinking hard he wants something mended    and he wants to reserve something in there    could you see what he pointed at when he said that one 
  
no he was behind that cabinet — 
  
you two stay here whispered hermione 
  
what are you —  
  
but hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak she checked her hair in the reflection in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell tinkling again ron hastily fed the extendable ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to harry 
  
hello horrible morning isnt it hermione said brightly to borgin who did not answer but cast her a suspicious look humming cheerily hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display 
  
is this necklace for sale she asked pausing beside a glassfronted case 
  
if youve got one and a half thousand galleons said mr 
  
borgin coldly 
  
oh — er — no i havent got quite that much said hermione walking on and    what about this lovely — um — skull 
  
sixteen galleons 
  
so its for sale then it isnt being    kept for anyone 
  
mr borgin squinted at her harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what hermione was up to apparently hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the 
  
winds 
  
the thing is that — er — boy who was in here just now draco malfoy well hes a friend of mine and i want to get him a birthday present but if hes already reserved anything i obviously dont want to get him the same thing so  um  
  
it was a pretty lame story in harrys opinion and apparently borgin thought so too 
  
out he said sharply get out 
  
hermione did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with borgin at her heels as the bell tinkled again borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign 
  
ah well said ron throwing the cloak back over hermione worth a try but you were a bit obvious — 
  
well next time you can show me how its done master of mystery she snapped 
  
ron and hermione bickered all the way back to weasleys 
  
wizard wheezes where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxiouslooking mrs weasley and hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence once in the shop harry whipped off the invisibility cloak hid it in his bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to mrs weasleys accusations that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly 
  
  

chapter seven the slug club


harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of malfoys behavior in knockturn alley what disturbed him most was the satisfied look on malfoys face as he had left the shop nothing that made malfoy look that happy could be good news to his slight annoyance however neither ron nor hermione seemed quite as curious about malfoys activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days
yes ive already agreed it was fishy harry said hermione a little impatiently she was sitting on the windowsill in fred and georges room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of advanced rune translation but havent we agreed there could be a lot of explanations
maybe hes broken his hand of glory said ron vaguely as he attempted to straighten his broomsticks bent tail twigs remember that shriveledup arm malfoy had
but what about when he said dont forget to keep that one safe asked harry for the umpteenth time that sounded to me like borgins got another one of the broken objects and malfoy wants both
you reckon said ron now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle
yeah i do said harry when neither ron nor hermione answered he said malfoys fathers in azkaban dont you think malfoy’d like revenge
ron looked up blinking
malfoy revenge what can he do about it
thats my point i dont know said harry frustrated but hes up to something and i think we should take it seriously his fathers a death eater and quot
harry broke off his eyes fixed on the window behind hermione his mouth open a startling thought had just occurred to him
harry said hermione in an anxious voice whats wrong
your scars not hurting again is it asked ron nervously
hes a death eater said harry slowly hes replaced his father as a death eater
there was a silence then ron erupted in laughter malfoy hes sixteen harry you think youknowwho would let malfoy join
it seems very unlikely harry said hermione in a repressive sort of voice what makes you think 
in madam malkins she didnt touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve it was his left arm hes been branded with the dark mark
ron and hermione looked at each other
well  said ron sounding thoroughly unconvinced
i think he just wanted to get out of there harry said hermione
he showed borgin something we couldnt see harry pressed on stubbornly something that seriously scared borgin it was the mark i know it he was showing borgin who he was dealing with you saw how seriously borgin took him
ron and hermione exchanged another look
im not sure harry   
yeah i still dont reckon youknowwho would let malfoy join  
annoyed but absolutely convinced he was right harry snatched up a pile of filthy quidditch robes and left the room mrs weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment on the landing he bumped into ginny who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes
i wouldnt go in the kitchen just now she warned him theres a lot of phlegm around
ill be careful not to slip in it harry smiled
sure enough when he entered the kitchen it was to find fleur sitting at the kitchen table in full flow about plans for her wedding to bill while mrs weasley kept watch over a pile of selfpeeling sprouts looking badtempered
   bill and i ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids ginny and gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer i am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold pink would of course be orrible with ginnys air quot
ah harry said mrs weasley loudly cutting across fleurs monologue good i wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to hogwarts tomorrow weve got ministry cars again and there will be aurors waiting at the station quot
is tonks going to be there asked harry handing over his quidditch things
no i dont think so shes been stationed somewhere else from what arthur said
she has let erself go zat tonks fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon a big mistake if you askquot
yes thank you said mrs weasley tartly cutting across fleur again youd better get on harry i want the trunks ready tonight if possible so we dont have the usual lastminute scramble
and in fact their departure the following morning was smoother than usual the ministry cars glided up to the front of the burrow to find them waiting trunks packed hermiones cat crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and hedwig rons owl pigwidgeon and ginnys new purple pygmy puff arnold in cages
au revoir any said fleur throatily kissing him goodbye ron hurried forward looking hopeful but ginny stuck out her foot and ron fell sprawling in the dust at fleurs feet furious redfaced and dirtspattered he hurried into the car without saying goodbye
there was no cheerful hagrid waiting for them at kings cross station instead two grimfaced bearded aurors in dark muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking
quick quick through the barrier said mrs weasley who
seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency harry had better go first with quot
she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized harrys upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten
i can walk thanks said harry irritably jerking his arm out of the aurors grip he pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and threequarters where the scarlet hogwarts express stood belching steam over the crowd
hermione and the weasleys joined him within seconds without waiting to consult his grimfaced auror harry motioned to ron and hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment
we cant harry said hermione looking apologetic ron and ive got to go to the prefects carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit
oh yeah i forgot said harry
youd better get straight on the train all of you youve only got a few minutes to go said mrs weasley consulting her watch well have a lovely term ron   
mr weasley can i have a quick word said harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment
of course said mr weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless
harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he was to tell anyone mr weasley was the right person firstly because he worked at the ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations and secondly
because he thought that there was not too much risk of mr weasley exploding with anger
he could see mrs weasley and the grimfaced auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away
when we were in diagon alley harry began but mr weasley forestalled him with a grimace
am i about to discover where you ron and hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of fred and georges shop
how did you 
harry please youre talking to the man who raised fred and george
er    yeah all right we werent in the back room very well then lets hear the worst
well we followed draco malfoy we used my invisibility cloak
did you have any particular reason for doing so or was it a mere whim
because i thought malfoy was up to something said harry disregarding mr weasleys look of mingled exasperation and amusement hed given his mother the slip and i wanted to know why
of course you did said mr weasley sounding resigned well did you find out why
he went into borgin and burkes said harry and started bullying the bloke in there borgin to help him fix something and he said he wanted borgin to keep something else for him he made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing like they were a pair and 
harry took a deep breath
theres something else we saw malfoy jump about a mile when madam malkin tried to touch his left arm i think hes been branded with the dark mark one think hes replaced his father as a death eater
mr weasley looked taken aback after a moment he said harry i doubt whether youknowwho would allow a sixteenyearold quot
does anyone really know what youknowwho would or wouldnt do asked harry angrily mr weasley im sorry but isnt it worth investigating if malfoy wants something fixing and he needs to threaten borgin to get it done its probably something dark or dangerous isnt it
i doubt it to be honest harry said mr weasley slowly you see when lucius malfoy was arrested we raided his house we took away everything that might have been dangerous i think you missed something said harry stubbornly well maybe said mr weasley but harry could tell that mr weasley was humoring him
there was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing
youd better hurry said mr weasley as mrs weasley cried harry quickly
he hurried forward and mr and mrs weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train
now dear youre coming to us for christmas its all fixed with dumbledore so well see you quite soon said mrs weasley through the window as harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move you make sure you look after yourself and quot
the train was gathering speed
be good and quot  she was jogging to keep up now
stay safe
harry waved until the train had turned a corner and mr and mrs weasley were lost to view then turned to see where the others had got to he supposed ron and hermione were cloistered in the prefects carriage but ginny was a little way along the corridor chatting to some friends he made his way toward her dragging his trunk
people stared shamelessly as he approached they even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him he had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the chosen one rumors in the daily prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight he tapped ginny on the shoulder
fancy trying to find a compartment
i cant harry i said id meet dean said ginny brightly see you later
right said harry he felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that ginny did not hang around with him ron and hermione while at school then he blinked and looked around he was surrounded by mesmerized girls
hi harry said a familiar voice from behind him
neville said harry in relief turning to see a roundfaced boy struggling toward him
hello harry said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes who was just behind neville
luna hi how are you
very well thank you said luna she was clutching a magazine to her chest large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free spectrespecs inside
quibbler still going strong then asked harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine having given it an exclusive interview the previous year
oh yes circulations well up said luna happily
lets find seats said harry and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students at last they found an empty compartment and harry hurried inside gratefully
theyre even staring at us said neville indicating himself and luna because were with you
theyre staring at you because you were at the ministry too said harry as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack our little adventure there was all over the daily prophet you mustve
seen it
yes i thought gran would be angry about all the publicity said neville but she was really pleased says im starting to live up to my dad at long last she bought me a new wand look
he pulled it out and showed it to harry
cherry and unicorn hair he said proudly we think it was one of the last ollivander ever sold he vanished next day oi come back here trevor
and he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom
are we still doing da meetings this year harry asked luna
who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of the quibbler
no point now weve got rid of umbridge is there said harry sitting down neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it he looked most disappointed
i liked the da i learned loads with you
i enjoyed the meetings too said luna serenely it was like having friends
this was one of those uncomfortable things luna often said and which made harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment before he could respond however there was a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of fourthyear girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass
you ask him
no you
ill do it
and one of them a boldlooking girl with large dark eyes a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door
hi harry im romilda romilda vane she said loudly and confidently why dont you join us in our compartment you dont have to sit with them she added in a stage whisper indicating nevilles bottom which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for trevor and luna who was now wearing her free spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl
theyre friends of mine said harry coldly
oh said the girl looking very surprised oh okay
and she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her
people expect you onezero have cooler friends than us said luna once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty
you are cool said harry shortly none of them was at the ministry they didnt fight with me
thats a very nice thing to say beamed luna then she pushed her spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read the
quibbler
we didnt face him though said neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resignedlooking trevor in his hand you did you should hear my gran talk about you that harry potters got more backbone than the whole ministry of magic put together shed give anything to have you as a grandson   
harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to owl results as soon as he could while neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a transfiguration newt with only an acceptable harry watched him without really listening
nevilles childhood had been blighted by voldemort just as much as harrys had but neville had no idea how close he had come to having harrys destiny the prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reasons voldemort had chosen to believe that harry was the one meant
had voldemort chosen neville it would be neville sitting opposite harry bearing the lightningshaped scar and the weight of the prophecy  or would it would neville’s mother have died to save him as lily had died for harry surely she would    but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and voldemort would there then have been no chosen one at all an empty seat where neville now sat and a scarless harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother not rons
you all right harry you look funny said neville
harry started sorry i quot
wrackspurt got you asked luna sympathetically peering at harry through her enormous colored spectacles
i —what
a wrackspurt   theyre invisible they float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy she said i thought i felt one zooming around in here
she flapped her hands at thin air as though beating off large invisible moths harry and neville caught each others eyes and hastily began to talk of quidditch
the weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer they passed through stretches of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight it was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible almost directly overhead that ron and hermione entered the compartment at last
wish the lunch trolley would hurry up im starving said ron longingly slumping into the seat beside harry and rubbing his stomach hi neville hi luna guess what he added turning to harry malfoy s not doing prefect duty hes just sitting in his compartment with the other slytherins we saw him when we passed
harry sat up straight interested it was not like malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year
what did he do when he saw you
the usual said ron indifferently demonstrating a rude hand
gesture not like him though is it well that is he did the hand gesture again but why isnt he out there bullying first years
dunno said harry but his mind was racing didnt this look as though malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students
maybe he preferred the inquisitorial squad said hermione maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that
i dont think so said harry i think hes quot
but before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless thirdyear girl stepped inside
im supposed to deliver these to neville longbottom and harry ppotter she faltered as her eyes met harrys and she turned scarlet she was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon perplexed harry and neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment
what is it ron demanded as harry unrolled his
an invitation said harryp 
harry
i would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment c
sincerely   
but what does he want me for asked neville nervously as though he was expecting detention
no idea said harry which was not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct listen he added seized by a sudden brain wave lets go under the invisibility cloak then we might get a good look at malfoy on the way see what hes up to
this idea however came to nothing the corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train every now and then students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him the exception was cho chang who darted into her compartment when she saw harry coming as harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend marietta who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face smirking slightly harry pushed on
when they reached compartment c they saw at once that they were not slughorns only invitees although judging by the enthusiasm of slughorns welcome harry was the most warmly anticipated
harry mboy said slughorn jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvetcovered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment his shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden
buttons on his waistcoat good to see you good to see you and you must be mr longbottom
neville nodded looking scared at a gesture from slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door harry glanced around at their fellow guests he recognized a slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long slanting eyes there were also two seventhyear boys harry did not know and squashed in the corner beside slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there ginny
now do you know everyone slughorn asked harry and neville blaise zabini is in your year of course 
zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did harry or neville gryffindor and slytherin students loathed each other on principle
this is cormac mclaggen perhaps youve come across each other  no
mclaggen a large wiryhaired youth raised a hand and harry and neville nodded back at him
and this is marcus belby i dont know whether 
belby who was thin and nervouslooking gave a strained smile
and this charming young lady tells me she knows you slughorn finished
ginny grimaced at harry and neville from behind slughorns back
well now this is most pleasant said slughorn cozily a chance to get to know you all a little better here take a napkin ive packed my own lunch the trolley as i remember it is heavy on
licorice wands and a poor old mans digestive system isnt quite up to such things    pheasant belby
belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant
i was just telling young marcus here that i had the pleasure of teaching his uncle damocles slughorn told harry and neville now passing around a basket of rolls outstanding wizard outstanding and his order of merlin most welldeserved do you see much of your uncle marcus
unfortunately beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer slughorn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke
anapneo said slughorn calmly pointing his wand at belby whose airway seemed to clear at once
not   not much of him no gasped belby his eyes streaming
well of course i daresay hes busy said slughorn looking questioningly at belby i doubt he invented the wolfsbane potion without considerable hard work
i suppose    said belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that slughorn had finished with him er  he and my dad dont get on very well you see so i dont really know much about
his voice tailed away as slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to mclaggen instead
now you cormac said slughorn i happen to know you see a lot of your uncle tiberius because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in i think norfolk
oh yeah that was fun that was said mclaggen we went with bertie higgs and rufus scrimgeour this was before he became minister obviously quot
ah you know bertie and rufus too beamed slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow belby was missed out now tell me   
it was as harry had suspected everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody wellknown or influential everyone except ginny zabini who was interrogated after mclaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from what harry could make out she had been married seven times each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold it was nevilles turn next this was a very uncomfortable ten minutes for nevilles parents wellknown aurors had been tortured into insanity by bellatrix lestrange and a couple of death eater cronies at the end of nevilles interview harry had the impression that slughorn was reserving judgment on neville yet to see whether he had any of his parents flair
and now said slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act harry potter where to begin i feel i barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer he contemplated harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant then said the chosen one theyre calling you now
harry said nothing belby mclaggen and zabini were all staring at him
of course said slughorn watching harry closely there have been rumors for years  i remember when well after that terrible night lily james and you survived and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary quot
zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to
indicate amused skepticism an angry voice burst out from behind slughorn
yeah zabini because youre so talented  at posing   
oh dear chuckled slughorn comfortably looking around at ginny who was glaring at zabini around slughorns great belly you want to be careful blaise i saw this young lady perform the most marvelous batbogey hex as i was passing her carriage i wouldnt cross her
zabini merely looked contemptuous
anyway said slughorn turning back to harry such rumors this summer of course one doesnt know what to believe the prophet has been known to print inaccuracies make mistakes but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all
harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing slughorn beamed at him
so modest so modest no wonder dumbledore is so fond you were there then but the rest of the stories so sensational of course one doesnt know quite what to believe this fabled prophecy for instance quot
we never heard a prophecy said neville turning geranium pink as he said it
thats right said ginny staunchly neville and i were both there too and all this chosen one rubbish is just the prophet making things up as usual
you were both there too were you said slughorn with great interest looking from ginny to neville but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile
yes   well it is true that the prophet often exaggerates of course    slughorn said sounding a little disappointed i remember dear gwenog telling me gwenog jones i mean of course captain of the holyhead harpies quot
he meandered off into a longwinded reminiscence but harry had the distinct impression that slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by neville and ginny
the afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the slug club at hogwarts harry could not wait to leave but couldnt see how to do so politely finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset and slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight
good gracious its getting dark already i didnt notice that theyd lit the lamps youd better go and change into your robes all of you mclaggen you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails harry blaise any time youre passing same goes for you miss he twinkled at ginny well off you go off you go
as he pushed past harry into the darkening corridor zabini shot him a filthy look that harry returned with interest he ginny and neville followed zabini back along the train
im glad thats over muttered neville strange man isnt he yeah he is a bit said harry his eyes on zabini how come you ended up in there ginny
he saw me hex zacharias smith said ginny you remember that idiot from hufflepuff who was in the da he kept on and on asking about what happened at the ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much i hexed him when slughorn came in i
thought i was going to got detention but he just thought it was i really good hex and invited me to lunch mad eh
better reason for inviting someone than because their mothers famous said harry scowling at the back of zabinis head or because their uncle quot
but he broke off an idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea  in a minutes time zabini was going to reenter the slytherin sixthyear compartment and malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow slytherins  if harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear true there was little of the journey left hogsmeade station had to be less than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows but nobody else seemed prepared to take harrys suspicions seriously so it was down to him to prove them
ill see you two later said harry under his breath pulling out his invisibility cloak and flinging it over himself
but whatre you  asked neville
later whispered harry darting after zabini as quietly as possible though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless
the corridors were almost completely empty now nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions though he was as close as he could get to zabini without touching him harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when zabini opened the door zabini was already sliding it shut when harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing
whats wrong with this thing said zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into harrys foot
harry seized the door and pushed it open hard zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into gregory goyles lap and in the ensuing ruckus harry darted into the compartment leapt onto zabinis temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack it was fortunate that goyle and zabini were snarling at each other drawing all eyes onto them for harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw malfoys eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight but then goyle slammed the door shut and flung zabini off him zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled vincent crabbe returned to his comic and malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seats with his head in pansy parkinsons lap harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off malfoys forehead smirking as she did so as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place the lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene harry could read every word of crabbes comic directly
below him
so zabini said malfoy what did slughorn want
just trying to make up to wellconnected people said zabini
who was still glowering at goyle not that he managed to find
many
this information did not seem to please malfoy who else had he invited he demanded
mclaggen from gryffindor said zabini
oh yeah his uncles big in the ministry said malfoy
someone else called belby from ravenclaw quot
not him hes a prat said pansy
and longbottom potter and that weasley girl finished zabini
malfoy sat up very suddenly knocking pansys hand aside
he invited longbottom
well i assume so as longbottom was there said zabini indifferently
whats longbottom got to interest slughorn
zabini shrugged
potter precious potter obviously he wanted a look at the chosen one sneered malfoy but that weasley girl whats so special about herp 
a lot of boys like her said pansy watching malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction even you think shes goodlooking dont you blaise and we all know how hard you are to please
i wouldnt touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like said zabini coldly and pansy looked pleased malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair
well i pity slughorns taste maybe hes going a bit senile shame my father always said he was a good wizard in his day my father used to be a bit of a favorite of his slughorn probably hasnt heard im on the train or quot
i wouldnt bank on an invitation said zabini he asked me about notts father when i first arrived they used to be old
friends apparently but when he heard hed been caught at the ministry he didnt look happy and nott didnt get an invitation did he one dont think slughorns interested in dearh eaters
malfoy looked angry but forced out a singularly humorless laugh
well who cares what hes interested in what is he when you come down to it just some stupid teacher malfoy yawned ostentatiously i mean i might not even be at hogwarts next year whats it matter to me if some fat old hasbeen likes me or not
what do you mean you might not be at hogwarts next year said pansy indignantly ceasing grooming malfoy at once
well you never know said malfoy with the ghost of a smirk i might have er moved on to bigger and better things
crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak harrys heart began to race what would ron and hermione say about this crabbe and goyle were gawping at malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things even zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features pansy resumed the slow stroking of malfoy s hair looking dumbfounded
do you mean —“
malfoy shrugged
mother wants me to complete my education but personally i dont see it as that important these days i mean think about it  when the dark lord takes over is he going to care how many owls or newts anyones got of course he isntitll be all about the kind of service he received the level of devotion he was shown
and you think youll be able to do something for him asked
zabini scathingly sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet
ive just said havent i maybe he doesnt care if im qualified maybe the job he wants me to do isnt something that you need to be qualified for said malfoy quietly
crabbe and goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles pansy was gazing down at malfoy as though she had never seen anything so aweinspiring
i can see hogwarts said malfoy clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window wed better get our robes on
harry was so busy staring at malfoy he did not notice goyle reaching up for his trunk as he swung it down it hit harry hard on the side of the head he let out an involuntary gasp of pain and malfoy looked up at the luggage rack frowning
harry was not afraid of malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his invisibility cloak by a group of unfriendly slytherins eyes still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand careful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held to his relief malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck
harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that hermione and ron would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied at last with a final lurch the train came to a complete halt goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out
into a crowd of second years punching them aside crabbe and zabini followed
you go on malfoy told pansy who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it i just want to check something
pansy left now harry and malfoy were alone in the compartment people were filing past descending onto the dark platform malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in he then bent down over his trunk and opened it again
harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster what had malfoy wanted to hide from pansy was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend
petrificus totalus
without warning malfoy pointed his wand at harry who was instantly paralyzed as though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing floorshaking crash at malfoys feet the invisibility cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position he couldnt move a muscle he could only gaze up at malfoy who smiled broadly
i thought so he said jubilantly i heard goyles trunk hit you and i thought i saw something white flash through the air after zabini came back   
his eyes lingered for a moment upon harrys trainers
you didnt hear anything i care about potter but while ive got you here   
him
and he stamped hard on harrys face harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere
thats from my father now lets see   
malfoy dragged the cloak out from under harrys immobilized body and threw it over him
i dont reckon theyll find you till the trains back in london he said quietly see you around potter  or not
and taking care to tread on harrys fingers malfoy left the compartment

chapter eight  victorious snape

harry could not move a muscle he lay there beneath the  invisibility cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond his immediate thought was that someone would surely would check the compartments before the train departed again but at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment he would be neither seen nor heard his best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him 
harry had never hated malfoy more than as he lay there like an absurd turtle on its back blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth what a stupid situation to have landed himself in and now the last few footsteps were dying away everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk
ron and hermione would think that he had left the train without them once they arrived at hogwarts and took their places in the great hall looked up and down the gryffindor table a few times and finally realized that he was not there he no doubt would be halfway back to london
he tried to make a sound even a grunt but it was impossible then he remembered that some wizards like dumbledore could perform spells without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the words accio wand over and over again in his head but nothing happened
he thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake and the faroff hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voices wondering where harry potter had gone a feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestraldrawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage malfoy was riding in where he could be recounting his attack on harry to crabbe goyle zabini and pansy parkinson
the train lurched causing harry to roll over onto his side now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling the floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life the express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it
then he felt his invisibility cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said wotcher harry
there was a flash of red light and harrys body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at tonks who was holding the invisibiliiv cloak she had just pulled away
wed better get out of here quickly she said as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station come on well jump
harry hurried after her into the corridor she pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum he followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view
the cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose tonks was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position silently she handed him back the invisibility cloak 
“who did it
“draco malfoy” said harry bitterly thanks for well 
“no problem” said tonks without smiling from what harry could see in the darkness she was as mousyhaired and miserablelookinng as she had been when he had met her at the burrow i can fix your nose if you stand still
harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit madam pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to healing spells but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed stockstill and closed his eyes 
“episkey said tonks
harry’s nose felt very hot and then very cold he raised a hand and felt gingerly it seemed to be mended 
“thanks a lot
“youd better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school said tonks still unsmiling as harry swung the cloak back over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery fourlegged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness
was that a patronus asked harry who had seen dumbledore send messages like this
yes im sending word to the castle that ive got you or theyll worry come on wed better not dawdle
they set off toward the lane that led to the school
how did you find me
i noticed you hadnt left the train and i knew you had that cloak i thought you might be hiding for some reason when i saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment i thought i’d check
but what are you doing here anyway harry asked 
im stationed in hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection said tonks
is it just you whos stationed up here or —  
no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too 
dawlish that auror dumbledore attacked last year 
thats right
they trudged up the dark deserted lane following the freshly made carriage tracks harry looked sideways at tonks under his cloak last year she had been inquisitive to the point of being a little annoying at times she had laughed easily she had made jokes now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful was this all the effect of what had happened at the ministry he reflected uncomfortably that hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about sirius to her that it hadnt been her fault at all but he couldnt bring himself to do it he was far from blaming her for siriuss death it was no more her fault than anyone else’s and much less than his but he did not like talking about sirius if he could avoid it and so they tramped on through the cold night in silence tonkss long cloak whispering on the ground behind them
having always traveled there by carriage harry had never before appreciated just how far hogwarts was from hogsmeade station with great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates each topped with a winged boar he was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new gloomy tonks behind but when he put out a hand to push open the gates he found them chained shut
“alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened
“that wont work on these said tonks dumbledore bewitched them himself
harry looked around i could climb a wall he suggested
“no you couldnt said tonks flatly antiintruder jinxes on all of them securitys been tightened a hundredfold this summer 
“well then” said harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness “i suppose ill just have to sleep out here and wait for morning”
“someones coming down for you said tonks look 
a lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure filchs wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews it was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them and had pulled off his invisibility cloak so that he could be seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black greasy hair of severus snape
well well well sneered snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open nice of you to turn up potter although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance
i couldnt change i didnt have my — harry began but snape cut across him
there is no need to wait nymphadora potter is quite — ah 
— safe in my hands
i meant hagrid to get the message said tonks frowning
hagrid was late for the startofterm feast just like potter here so i took it instead and incidentally said snape standing back to allow harry to pass him i was interested to see your new patronus
he shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again so that they slithered clinking back into place
i think you were better off with the old one said snape the malice in his voice unmistakable the new one looks weak
as snape swung the lantern about harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on tonkss face then she was covered in darkness once more
good night harry called to her over his shoulder as he began the walk up to the school with snape thanks for  everything
see you harry
snape did not speak for a minute or so harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredibie that snape could not feel them burning him he had loathed snape from their first encounter but snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of harrys forgiveness by his attitude toward sirius whatever dumbledore said harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that snapes snide remarks to sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the order of the phoenix were off fighting voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in sirius rushing off to the ministry the night that he had died harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame snape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that sirius was dead it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness 
“fifty points from gryffindor for lateness i think said snape “and let me see another twenty for your muggle attire you know i don’t believe any house has ever been in negative figures this early in the term we havent even started pudding you might have set a record potter
the fury and hatred bubbling inside harry seemed to blaze whitehot but he would rather have been immobilized all the way
back to london than tell snape why he was late
“i suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you snape
continued and with no flying car available you decided that
bursting into the great hall halfway through the feast ought to
create a dramatic effect
still harry remained silent though he thought his chest might
explode he knew that snape had come to fetch him for this for
the few minutes when he could needle and torment harry without
anyone else listening
they reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the great hail harry wondered whether he could slip his invisibility cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long gryffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed as though he had read harrys mind however snape said no cloak you can walk in so that everyone sees you which is what you wanted im sure
harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors anything to get away from snape the great hall with its four long house tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow it was ail a shimmering blur to harry however who walked so fast that he was passing the hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted ron and hermione sped along the benches toward them mil forced his way in between them
whereve you — blimey whatve you done to your face said ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity i
why whats wrong with it said harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection
youre covered in blood said hermione come here —
she raised her wand said tergeo and siphoned off the dried blood
thanks said harry feeling his now clean face hows my nose looking
“normal said hermoine anxiously why shouldnt it harry what happened weve been terrified
“ill tell you later said harry curtly he was very conscious that ginny neville dean and seamus were listening in even nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop
“but — said hermione
“not now hermione said harry in a darkly significant voice he hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic preferably involving a couple of death eaters and a dementor of course malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could but there was always a chance it wouldnt reach too many gryffindor ears
he reached across ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful chips but before he could take them they vanished to be replaced with puddings
“you missed the sorting anyway said hermione as ron dived a largt chocolate gateau 
“hat say anything interesting asked harry taking a piece of treacle tart
“more of the same really    advising us all to unite in the face enemies you know 
“dumbledore mentioned voldemort at all not yet but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast doesnt he it cant be long now 
“snape said hagrid was late for the feast — 
“youve seen snape how come said ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau
bumped into him said harry evasively
hagrid was only a few minutes late said hermione look hes waving at you harry
harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at hagrid who was indeed waving at him hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house the top of whose head came up to somewhere between hagrids elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting harry was surprised to see the divination teacher professor trelawney sitting on hagrids other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the startofterm feast before she looked as odd as ever glittering with beads and trailing shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles having always considered her a bit of a fraud harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused lord voldemort to kill harrys parents and attack harry himself the knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company thankfully this year he would be dropping divination her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction he hastily looked away toward the slytherin table draco malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his insides burning again what he would give to fight malfoy oneonone
so what did professor slughorn want hermione asked
to know what really happened at the ministry said harry
him and everyone else here sniffed hermione people were interrogating us about it on the train werent they ron
yeah said ron all wanting to know if you really are the chosen one —
there has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts interrupted nearly headless nick inclining his barely connected head toward harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff i am considered something of a potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly i have assured the spirit community that i will not pester you for information however harry potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence i told them i would rather die than betray his trust 
“thats nor saying much seeing as youre already dead ron observed
“once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe said nearly headless nick in affronted tones and he rose into the air glided back toward the far end of the gryffindor table just as dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table the talk and laughter echoing around the hall died away almost instantly
the very best of evenings to you he said smiling broadly his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room 
“what happened to his hand gasped hermione
she was not the only one who had noticed dumbledores right hand was as blackened and deadlooking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch harry from the dursleys whispers it the room dumbledore interpreting them correctly merely smiled and shook his purpleandgold sleeve over his injury 
“nothing to worry about he said airily now  to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back another year full of magical education awaits you   
his hand was like that when i saw him over the summer
harry whispered to hermione i thought hed have cured it by now though  or madam pomfrey wouldve done
it looks as if its died said hermione with a nauseated expression but there are some injuries you cant cure old curses…and there are poisons without antidotes   
   and mr filch our caretaker has asked me to say chat there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called weasleys wizard wheezes
those wishing to play for their house quidditch teams should give their names to their heads of house as usual we are also looking for new quidditch commentators who should do likewise
we are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year professor slughorn— slughorn stood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow — is a former colleague of mine who has agreed resume his old post of potions master
potions
potions
the word echoed all over the hall as people wondered wheel they had heard right
potions said ron and hermione together turning to stare harry but you said —
professor snape meanwhile said dumbledore raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering will be taking the position of defense against the dark arts teacher
no said harry so loudly that many heads turned in his direction he did not care he was staring up at the staff table incensed how could snape be given the defense against the dark arts job after all this time hadnt it been widely known for years that dumbledore did not trust him to do it 
“but harry you said that slughorn was going to be teaching defense against the dark arts said hermione 
i thought he was said harry racking his brains to remember when dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he was unable to recall dumbledore ever telling him what slughorn would be teaching
snape who was sitting on dumbledores right did not stand up his mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the slytherin table yet harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much
“well theres one good thing he said savagely snapell be gone by the end of the year 
“what do you mean asked ron
“that jobs jinxed no ones lasted more than a year    quirrell actually died doing it    personally im going to keep my fingers crossed for another death   
“harry said hermione shocked and reproachful 
“he might just go back to teaching potions at the end of the year said ron reasonably that slughorn bloke might not want to stay longterm moody didnt
